This is a Markov chain implementation in C# that I've named Ricky. I've written two versions, both are included here. V2 is much more consisent and readible than V1 but less capable of random genius.

IF YOU ARE A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER PLEASE KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MY TYPICAL ADHERANCE TO BOTH PROFESSIONAL CODING STANDARDS AND COMMON DECENCY.
