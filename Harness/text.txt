Substantial evidence exists linking members of this country s intelligence community  including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Advanvced Research Projects Agency, and the Office of Naval Intelligence  with the  esoteric technology of MIND CONTROL.  For decades,  spy chiatrists  working behind the scenes    on college campuses, in CIA sponsored institutes, and  most heinously  in prisons    have experimented with the erasure of memory, hypnotic resistance to torture, truth serums, post hypnotic suggestion, rapid induction of hypnosis, electronic stimulation of the brain, non ionizing radiation, microwave induction of intracerebral  voices,  and a host of even more disturbing technologies.  Some of the projects exploring these areas were ARTICHOKE, BLUEBIRD, PANDORA, MKDELTA, MKSEARCH and the infamous MKULTRA.    I have read nearly every available book on these projects, as well as the relevant congressional testimony   .  I have also spent much time in university libraries researching relevant articles, contacting other researchers  who have graciously allowed me access to their files , and conducting interviews. Moreover, I traveled to Washington, DC to review the files John Marks compiled  when he wrote THE SEARCH FOR  THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE    .  These files  include some   ,    pages of CIA and Defense Department documents, interviews, scientific articles, letters, etc.  The views presented here are the result of extensive and ongoing research.    As a result of this research, I have come to the following conclusions:     .  Although misleading  and occasionally perjured  testimony before Congress indicated that the CIA s  brainwashing  efforts met with little success   , striking advances were, in fact, made in this field.  As CIA veteran Miles Copeland once admitted to a reporter,  The congressional  subcommittee which went into this sort of thing got only the barest glimpse.          .  Clandestine research into thought manipulation has NOT stopped, despite CIA protestations that it no longer sponsors such studies.  Victor Marchetti,    year veteran of the CIA and author of the renown expose, THE CIA AND THE CULT OF INTELLIGENCE, confirmed in a      interview that the mind control  research continues, and that CIA claims to the contrary are a  cover story.         .  The Central Intelligence Agency was not the only government agency  involved in this research    .  Indeed, many branches of our government took part in these studies    including NASA, the Atomic Energy Commission, as well as all branches of the Defense Department.                               II. The Technology A BRIEF OVERVIEW    In the early days of World War II, George Estabrooks, of Colgate University, wrote to the Department of War, describing in breathless terms the possible  uses of hypnosis in warfare    .  The Army was intrigued; Estabrooks had a  job.  The true history of Estabrooks  wartime collaboration with the CID, FBI     and other agencies may never be told: After the war, he burned his diary pages covering the years        , and thereafter avoided discussing his continuing government work with anyone, even close members of the family    . Occasionally, he strongly intimated that his work involved the creation of hypno programmed couriers and hypnotically induced split personalities, but whether he succeeded in these areas remains a controversial point.  Neverthe  less, the eccentric and flamboyant Estabrooks remains a pivotal figure in the early history of clandestine behavioral research.    Which is not to say that he worked alone.  World War II was the first  conflict in which the human brain became a field of battle, where invading forces were led by the most notable names in psychology and pharmacology.  On both sides, the war spurred furious efforts to create a  truth drug  for use in interrogating prisoners.  General William  Wild Bill  Donovan, director of the OSS, tasked his crack team    including Dr. Winifred Overhulser, Dr.  Edward Strecker, Harry J. Anslinger and George White    to modify human  perception and behavior through chemical means; their  medicine cabinet  included scopolamine, peyote, barbiturates, mescaline, and marijuana.   This research had its amusing side: Donovan s  psychic warriors  conducted many extensive and expensive trials before deciding that the best method of administering tetrahydrocannibinol, the active ingredient in marijuana, was via the cigarette.  Any jazz musician could have told them as much    .     Simultaneously, the notorious NAZI doctors at Dachau experimented with mescaline as a means of eliminating the victim s will to resist.  Jews, slavs, gypsies, and other  Untermenschen  in the camp were surreptitiously slipped the drug; later, mescaline was combined with hypnosis    .  The results of these tests were made available to the United States after the War.   cf. Operation PAPERCLIP, which transferred thousands of German and Japanese intelligence researchers directly into the U.S. intelligence community.   Our Germans are BETTER than their Germans!    DR. STRANGELOVE    jpg     In     , the Navy conducted the first known post war mind control program, Project CHAPTER, which continued the drug experiments.  Decades later,  journalists and investigators still haven t uncovered much information about  this project    or, indeed, about any of the military s other excursions into this field.  We know that the Army eventually founded operations THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT; other project names remain mysterious, though the existence of these programs is unquestionable.    The newly formed CIA plunged into this cesspool in     , with Project BLUEBIRD, rechristened ARTICHOKE in     .  To establish a  cover story  for this research, the CIA funded a propaganda effort designed to convince the world that the Communist Bloc had devised insidious new methods of re shaping the human will; the CIA s own efforts could therefore, if exposed, be explained as an attempt to  catch up  with Soviet and Chinese work.  The primary promoter of this  line  was one Edward Hunter, a CIA contract employee operating under  cover as a journalist, and, later, a prominent member of the John Birch  society.   Hunter was an OSS veteran of the China theatre    the same spawning grounds which produced Richard Helms, Howard Hunt, Mitch WerBell, Fred  Chrisman, Paul Helliwell and a host of other noteworthies who came to  dominate that strange land where the worlds of intelligence and right wing extremism meet    .   Hunter offered  brainwashing  as the explanation for the numerous confessions signed by American prisoners of war during the Korean War and  generally  UN recanted upon the prisoners  repatriation.  These confes  sions alleged that the United States used germ warfare in the Korean conflict, a claim which the American public of the time found impossible to accept. Many years later, however, investigative reporters discovered that Japan s germ warfare specialists  who had wreaked incalculable terror on the conquered Chinese during WWII  had been mustered into the American national security apparat    and that the knowledge gleaned from Japan s horrifying germ  warfare experiments probably WAS used in Korea, just as the  brainwashed   soldiers had indicated    .  Thus, we now know that the entire brainwashing scare of the     s constituted a CIA hoax perpetrated upon the American  public: CIA deputy director Richard Helms admitted as much when, in     ,  he told the Warren Commission that Soviet mind control research consistently lagged years behind American efforts    .    When the CIA s mind control program was transferred from the Office of Security to the Technical Services Staff  TSS  in     , the name changed again    to MKULTRA    .  Many consider this wide ranging  octopus  project    whose tentacles twined through the corridors of numerous universities and around the necks of an army of scientists    the most ominous operation in CIA s catalogue of atrocity.  Through MKULTRA, the Agency created an umbrella program of a positively Joycean scope, designed to ferret out all possible means of invading what George Orwell once called  the space between our ears   Later still, in     , mind control research was transferred to the Office  of Research and Development; project cryptonyms remain unrevealed    .     What was studied?  Everything    including hypnosis, conditioning, sensory deprivation, drugs, religious cults, microwaves, psychosurgery, brain implants, and even ESP.  When MKULTRA  leaked  to the public during the great CIA  investigations of the     s, public attention focused most heavily on drug experimentation and the work with ESP    .  Mystery still shrouds another area of study, the area which seems to have most interested ORD: psychoelectronics. IMPLANTS    ... a device known as a  stimoceiver,  invented in the late    s  early    s by a neuroscientist named Jose Delgado.  The stimoceiver is a  miniature depth electrode which can receive and transmit electronic signals over FM radio waves.  By stimulating a correctly positioned stimoceiver, an outside operator can wield a surprising degree of control over the subject s responses.    The most famous example of the stimoceiver in action occurred in a Madrid bull ring.  Delgado  wired  the bull before stepping into the ring, entirely unprotected.  Furious for gore, the bull charged toward the doctor    then stopped, just before reaching him.  The technician turned toreador had halted the animal by simply pushing a button on a black box, held in the hand    .    Delgado s PHYSICAL CONTROL OF THE MIND: TOWARD A PSYCHOCIVILISED SOCIETY     remains the sole, full length, popularly written work on intracerebral implants and electronic stimulation of the brain  ESB .   The book s ominous title and unconvincing philosophical rationales for mass mind control prompted an unfavorable public reaction    which may have deterred other researchers from publishing on this theme for a general audience.   While subsequent work has long since superceded the techniques described in this book, Delgado s  achievements were seminal.  His animal and human experiments clearly demon  strate that the experimenter can electronically induce emotions and behavior: Under certain conditions, the extremes of temperament    rage, lust, fatigue, etc.    can be elicited by an outside operator as easily as an organist might call forth a C major chord.    Delgado writes:  Radio stimulation of different points in the amygdala and hippocampus in the four patients produced a variety of effects, including  pleasant sensations, elation, deep, thoughtful concentration, odd feelings, super relaxation, colored visions, and other responses.       The evocative phrase  colored vision  clearly indicates remotely induced hallucination; we will detail later how these hallucinations may be  controlled  by an outside operator.    Speaking in         and reflecting research undertaken years previous    Delgado asserted that his experiments  support the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion, and behavior can be directed by electrical forces and that humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons.       He even prophesied a day when brain control could be turned over to non human operators, by establishing two way radio communication between the implanted brain and a computer    .     Of one experimental subject, Delgado notes that  the patient expressed the successive sensations of fainting, fright and floating around.  These   floating  feelings were repeatedly evoked on different days by stimulation of the same point...      ...    In a fascinating series of experiments, Delgado attached the stimoceiver to the tympanic membrane, thereby transforming the ear into a sort of micro  phone.  An assistant would whisper  How are you?  into the ear of a suitably  fixed  cat, and Delgado could hear the words over a loudspeaker in the next room.  The application of this technology to the spy trade should be readily apparent.  According to Victor Marchetti, The Agency once attempted a highly  sophisticated extension of this basic idea, in which radio implants were attached to a cat s cochlea, to facilitate the pinpointing of specific  conversations, freed from extraneous surrounding noises    .  Such  advances  exacerbate the already imposing level of Twentieth Century paranoia: Not only can our phones be tapped and mail checked, but even TABBY may be spying on us!    Yet the ramifications of this technology may go even deeper than Marchetti indicates.  I presume that if a suitably wired subject s inner ear can be made into a microphone, it can also be made into a loudspeaker    one possible explanation for ...  voices  ... .  ... Indeed, not many years after Delgado s experiments with the cat,  Ralph Schwitzgebel devised a  bug in the ear  via which the therapist    odd term, under the circumstances    can communicate with his subject    .    Other researchers have made notable contributions to this field.      Robert G. Heath, of Tulane University, who has implanted as many as     electrodes in his subjects, achieved his greatest notoriety by attempting to  cure  homosexuality through ESB.  In his experiments, he discovered that he could control his patients  memory ... ; he could also  induce sexual arousal, fear, pleasure, and hallucinations    .    Heath and another researcher, James Olds    , have independently illustrated that areas of the brain in and near the hypothalamus have, when electronically stimulated, what has been described as  rewarding  and  aversive  effects. Both animals and men, when given the means to induce their own ESB of the  brain s pleasure centers, will stimulate themselves at a tremendous rate, ignoring such basic drives as hunger and thirst    .   Using fixed electrodes of his own invention, John C. Lilly had accomplished similar effects in the early     s    .   ... B.F. Skinner esque aversive therapy,  remotely appiled, was Heath s prescription for  healing  homosexuality    .    Ralph Schwitzgebel and his brother Robert have produced a panoply of devices for tracking individuals over long ranges; they may be considered the creators of the  electronic house arrest  devices recently approved by the courts    .  Schwitzgebel devices could be used for tracking all the physical and neurological signs of a  patient  within a quarter of a mile    , thereby lifting the distance limitations which restricted Delgado.    In Ralph Schwitzgebel s initial work, application of this technology to ESB seems to have been limited to cumbersome brain implants with protruding wires.  But the technology was soon miniaturized, and a scheme was proposed whereby radio receivers would be mounted on utility poles throughout a  given city, thereby providing    hour a day monitoring capability    .  Like Heath, Schwitzgebel was much exercised about homosexuality and the use of intracranial devices to combat sexual deviation.  But he has also spoken ominously about applying his devices to  socially troublesome persons ... which, of course, could mean anyone    .    Bryan Robinson, of the Yerkes primate laboratory has conducted fascinating simian research on the use of remote ESB in a social context.  He could cause mothers to ignore their offspring, despite the babies  cries.  He could turn submission into dominance, and vice versa    .    Perhaps the most disturbing wanderer into this mind field is Joseph A. Meyer, of the National Security Agency, the most formidable and secretive  component of America s national security complex.  Meyer has proposed implant  ing roughly half of all Americans arrested    not necessarily convicted    of any crime; the numbers of  subscribers   his euphemism  would run into the tens of millions.   Subscribers  could be monitored continually by computer wherever they went.  Meyer, who has carefully worked out the economics of his mass implantation system, asserts that taxpayer liability should be reduced  by forcing subscribers to  rent  the implant from the State.  Implants are cheaper and more efficient than police, Meyer suggests, since the call to crime is relentless for the poor  urban dweller     who, this spook scientist admits in a surprisingly candid aside, is fundamentally unnecessary to a post  industrial economy.   Urban dweller  may be another of Meyer s euphemisms: He uses New York s Harlem as his model community in working out the details of his mind management system    .    ... a Florida doctor named Daniel Man ... recently proposed a draconian solution to the overblown  missing children problem,  by suggesting a program wherein America s youngsters would be implanted with tiny transmitters in order to track the children continuously. Man brags that the operation can be done right in the office    and would take less than    minutes    .    Conceivably, it might take a tad longer in the field. A QUESTION OF TIMING    The history of brain implantation, as gleaned from the open literature, is certainly disquieting.  Yet this history has almost certainly been censored,  and the dates manipulated in a nigh Orwellian fashion.  When dealing with  research funded by the engines of national security, one can never know the true origin date of any individual scientific advance.  However, if we listen carefully to the scientists who have pioneered this research, we may hear whispers, faint but unmistakable, hinting that remotely applied ESB originated earlier than published studies would indicate.    In his autobiography THE SCIENTIST, John C. Lilly  who would later achieve a cultish reknown for his work with dolphins, drugs and sensory deprivation  records a conversation he had with the director of the National Institute of Mental Health    in     .  The director asked Lilly to brief the CIA, FBI, NSA and the various military intelligence services on his work using electrodes to stimulate directly the pleasure and pain centers of the brain.  Lilly refused, noting, in his reply:             Dr. Antoine Remond, using our techniques in Paris, has          demonstrated that this method of stimulation of the brain          can be applied to the human without the help of the neuro           surgeon; he is doing it in his office in Paris without neuro           surgical supervision.  This means that anybody with the proper          apparatus can carry this out on a person covertly, with no          external signs that electrodes have been used on that person.          I feel that if this technique got into the hands of a secret          agency, they would have total control over a human being and          be able to change his beliefs extremely quickly, leaving          little evidence of what they had done    .    Lilly s assertion of the moral high ground here is interesting.  Despite his avowed phobia against secrecy, a careful reading of THE SCIENTIST reveals  that he continued to do work useful to this country s national security appar  atus. His sensory deprivation experiments expanded upon the work of ARTICHOKE s  Maitland Baldwin, and even his dolphin research has    perhaps inadvertently proved useful in naval warfare    .  One should note that Lilly s work on monkeys carried a  secret  classification, and that NIMH was a common CIA funding conduit.    But the most important aspect of Lilly s statement is its date.      ? How far back does radio controlled ESB go?  Alas, I have not yet seen Remond s work    if it is available in the open literature.  In the documents made available to Marks, the earliest reference to remotely applied ESB is a      financial document pertaining to MKULTRA subproject   .  The general subproject descriptions sent to the CIA s financial department rarely contain much information, and rarely change from year to year, leaving us little idea as to when this subproject began.    Unfortunately, even the Freedom of Information Act couldn t pry loose much information on electronic mind control techniques, though we know a great deal of study was done in these areas.  We have, for example, only four pages on subproject       by comparison, a veritable flood of documents were released on the use of drugs in mind control.   Whenever an author tells us that MKULTRA  met with little success, the reference is to drug testing.   On this point, I  must criticize John Marks: His book never mentions that roughly       percent  of the  subprojects are  dark     i.e., little or no information was ever made available, despite lawyers and FOIA requests.  Marks seems to feel that the  only information worth having is the information he received.  We know,  however, that research into psychoelectronics was extensive indeed, statements of project goals dating from ARTICHOKE and BLUEBIRD days clearly identify this area as a high priority.  Marks  anonymous informant, jocularly named  Deep Trance,  even told a previous interviewer that, beginning in     , CIA and the military s mind control efforts strongly emphasized electronics    .  I therefore assume    not rashly, I hope    that the  dark  MKULTRA subprojects concerned matters such as brain implants, microwaves, ESB, and related  technologies.    I make an issue of the timing and secrecy involved in this research to underscore three points:   . We can never know with certainty the true origin dates of the various brainwashing methods    often, we discover that techniques which seem impossibly futuristic actually originated in the   th century.    Pioneering ESB research was conducted in     , by J.R. Ewald,  professor of physiology at Straussbourg    .    . The open literature almost certainly gives a bowdlerized view of the actual research.   . Lavishly funded clandestine researchers    unrestrained by peer review or the need for strict controls    can achieve far more rapid progress than scientists  on the  outside.     We have amply demonstrated, then, that as far back as the     s    and  possibly earlier still    scientists have had the capability to create implants ... .  Indeed, we have no notion just how advanced this technology has become, since the popular press stopped reporting on brain implantation in the     s. The research  has no doubt continued, albeit in a less public fashion. In fact, scientists such as Delgado have cast their eye far beyond the  implants; ESB effects can now be elicited with microwaves and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, used with and without electrodes. REMOTE HYPNOSIS One thing we know with certainty: Since the earliest days of project BLUEBIRD, the CIA s spy chiatrists spent enormous sums mastering Mesmer s art.    I cannot here give even a brief summary of hypnosis, nor even of the CIA s studies in this area.   Fortunately, FOIA requests were rather more successful in shaking loose information on this topic than in the area of psycho  electronics.   Here, we will concentrate on a particularly intriguing  allegation    one heard faintly, but persistently, for the past twenty years by those who would investigate the shadow side of politics.    If this allegation proves true, hypnosis is NOT necessarily a person to  person affair.    The ... mind control victim ... need not have physical contact with a hypnotist for hypnotic suggestion to take effect; trance could be induced, and suggestions made, via the intracerebral transmitters described above.  The concept sounds like something out of Huxley s or Orwell s most masochistic fantasies.  Yet remote hypnosis was first reported    using  allegedly parapsychological means    in the early     s, by L.L. Vasilev,  Professor of Physiology in the University of Leningrad    .  Later, other  scientists attempted to accomplish the same goal, using less mystic means.    Over the years, certain journalists have asserted that the CIA has mastered a technology call RHIC EDOM.  RHIC means  Radio Hypnotic Intracerebral  Control.   EDOM stands for  Electronic Dissolution of Memory.   Together, these techniques can    allegedly    remotely induce hypnotic trance, deliver suggestions to the subject, and erase all memory for both the instruction  period and the act which the subject is asked to perform.    RHIC uses the stimoceiver, or a microminiaturized offspring of that tech  nology to induce a hypnotic state.  ... this technique is also  reputed to involve the use of INTRAMUSCULAR implants... .  Apparently,  these implants are stimulated to induce a post hypnotic suggestion.    EDOM is nothing more than missing time itself    the erasure of memory from consciousness through the blockage of synaptic transmission in certain areas of the brain.  By jamming the brain s synapses through a surfeit of acetocholine, neural transmission along selected pathways can be effectively stilled. According to the proponents of RHIC EDOM, acetocholine production can be affected by electromagnetic means.   Modern research in the psycho physio  logical effects of microwaves confirm this proposition.     Does RHIC EDOM exist?  In our discussion of Delgado s work, I have already cited a strange little book  published in       titled WERE WE CONTROLLED?, written by one Lincoln Lawrence, a former FBI agent turned journalist.   The name is a pseudonym; I know his real identity.   This work deals at length with RHIC EDOM; a careful comparison of Lawrence s work with MKULTRA files declas  sified ten years later indicates a strong possibility that the writer did  indeed have  inside  sources.    Here is how Lawrence describes RHIC in action:          It is the ultra sophisticated application of post hypnotic       suggestion TRIGGERED AT WILL  italics in original  by radio       transmission.  It is a recurring hypnotic state, re induced       automatically at intervals by the same radio control.  An       individual is brought under hypnosis.  This can be done either       with his knowledge     or WITHOUT it by use of narco hypnosis,       which can be brought into play under many guises.  He is then       programmed to perform certain actions and maintain certain        attitudes upon radio signal    .    Other authors have mentioned this technique    specifically Walter Bowart  in his book OPERATION MIND CONTROL  and journalist James Moore, who, in a      issue of a periodical called MODERN PEOPLE, claimed to have secured a      page manual, prepared in     , on RHIC EDOM    .  He received the manual from CIA sources, although    interestingly    the technique is said to have originated in the military.          Medically, these radio signals are directed to certain        parts of the brain.  When a part of your brain receives a        tiny electrical impulse from outside sources, such as vision,       hearing, etc.,an emotion is produced    anger at the sight of       a gang of boys beating an old woman, for example.  The same        emotion of anger can be created by artificial radio signals        sent to your brain by a controller.  You could instantly feel        the same white hot anger without any apparent reason    .    Lawrence s sources imparted an even more tantalizing    and frightening    revelation:          ...there is already in use a small EDOM generator transmitter       which can be concealed on the body of a person.  Contact with       this person    a casual handshake or even just a touch           transmits a tiny electronic charge plus an ultra sonic signal       tone which for a short while will disturb the time orientation       of the person affected    .                                At present, I cannot claim conclusively that RHIC EDOM is real.  To my  knowledge, the only official questioning of a CIA representive concerning these techniques occurred in     , during Senate hearings on CIA drug testing. Senator Richard Schweicker had the following interchange with Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, an important MKULTRA administrator:          SCHWEICKER:  Some of the projects under MKULTRA involved       hypnosis, is that correct?          GOTTLIEB:    Yes.          SCHWEICKER:  Did any of these projects involve something       called radio hypnotic intracerebral control, which is a        combination, as I understand it, in layman s terms, of radio       transmissions and hypnosis.          GOTTLIEB:    My answer is  No.           SCHWEICKER:  None whatsoever?          GOTTLIEB:    Well, I am trying to be responsive to the       terms you used.  As I remember it, there was a current       interest, running interest, all the time in what effects       people s standing in the field of radio energy have, and       it could easily have been that somewhere in many projects,       someone was trying to see if you could hypnotize someone       easier if he was standing in a radio beam.  That would        seem like a reasonable piece of research to do.    Schweicker went on to mention that he had heard testimony that radar  i.e., microwaves  had been used to wipe out memory in animals; Gottlieb responded,  I can believe that, Senator.         Gottlieb s blandishments do not comfort much.  For one thing, the good doctor did not always provide thoroughly candid testimony.   During the same hearing he averred that    percent on the CIA s research had been openly  published; if so, why are so many MKULTRA subprojects still  dark,  and why does the Agency still go to great lengths to protect the identities of its scientists?       We should also recognize that the CIA s operations are compartmentalized on a  need to know  basis; Gottlieb may not have had access to the information requested by Schweicker.  Note that the MKULTRA rubric  circumscribed Gottlieb s statement: RHIC EDOM might have been the focus of another program.   There were several others: MKNAOMI, MKACTION, MKSEARCH,  etc.   Also keep in mind the revelation by  Deep Trance  that the CIA  concentrated on psychoelectronics AFTER the termination of MKULTRA in     .  Most significantly: RHIC EDOM is described by both Lawrence and Moore as a product of MILITARY research; Gottlieb spoke only of matters pertaining to CIA. He may thus have spoken truthfully    at least in a strictly technical sense    while still misleading the Congressional interlocutors.    Personally, I believe that the RHIC EDOM story deserves a great deal of further research.  I find it significant that when Dr. Petter Lindstrom  examined X rays of Robert Naesland, a Swedish victim of brain implantation, the doctor authoritatively cited WERE WE CONTROLLED? in his letter of response    . This is the same Dr. Lindstrom noted for his pioneering use of ultrasonics in neurosurgery    .  Lincoln Lawrence s book has received a strong endorsement indeed.    Bowart s OPERATION MIND CONTROL contains a significant interview with an intelligence agent knowledgeable in these areas.  Granted, the reader has every right to adopt a skeptical attitude toward information culled from anonymous sources; still, one should note that this operative s statements confirm, in pertinent part, Lawrence s thesis    .    Most importantly: The open literature on brain wave entrainment and the behavioral effects of electromagnetic radiation substantiates much of the RHIC  EDOM story    as we shall see. THAT S ENTRAINMENT    Robert Anton Wilson, an author with a devoted cult following, recently has taken to promoting a new generation of  mind machines  designed to promote creativity, stimulate learning, and alter consciousness    i.e., provide a drug less high.  Interestingly, these machines can also induce  Out of Body  Experiences,  in which the percipient mentally  travels  to another location while his body remains at rest    .  This rapidly developing technology has spawned a technological equivalent to the drug culture; indeed, the aficionados of the electronic buzz even have their own magazine, REALITY HACKERS.  Now  defunct.   jpg   I strongly suspect that we will hear much of these machines in the future.    One such device is called the  hemi synch.   This headphone like invention produces slightly different frequences in each ear; the brain calculates the difference between these frequencies, resulting in a rhythm known as the  binaural beat.   The brain  entrains  itself to this beat    that is, the subject s EEG slows down or speeds up to keep pace with its electronic  running partner    .    The brain has a  beat  of its own.    This rhythm was first discovered in      by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger, who recorded cerebral voltages as part of a telepathy study    .  He noted two distinct frequencies: alpha       cycles per second , associated with a relaxed, alert state, and beta        cycles per second , produced  during states of agitation and intense mental concentration.  Later, other rhythms were noted, which are particularly important for our present purposes: theta      cycles per second , a hypnogogic state, and delta  .  to  .  cycles per second , generally found in sleeping subjects    .    The hemi synch    and related mind machines    can produce alpha or theta waves, on demand, according to the operator s wishes.  A suitably entrained brain is much more responsive to suggestion, and is even likely to experience vivid hallucinations. ...    There s more than one way to entrain a brain.  Michael Hutchison s excellent book MEGA BRAIN details the author s personal experiences with many such  devices    the Alpha stim, TENS, the Synchro energizer, Tranquilite, etc.  He recounts dazzling, Dali esque hallucinations, as a result of using this mind  expanding technology; moreover, he offers a seductive argument that these  devices may represent a true breakthrough in consciousness control, thereby fulfilling the dashed dream of the hallucinogenic    s.    I wish to avoid a knee jerk Luddite response to these fascinating wonder  boxes.  At the same time, I recognize the dangers involved.  What about the possibility of an outside operator literally  changing our minds  by altering our brainwaves without our knowledge or permission?  If these machines can induce a hypnotic state, what s to stop a skilled hypnotist from making use of this state?    Granted, most of these devices require some physical interaction with the subject.  But a tool called the Bio Pacer can, according to its manufacturer, produce a number of mood altering frequencies    WITHOUT attachment to the subject.  Indeed, the Bio Pacer III  a high powered version  can affect an entire room.  This device costs $   , according to the most recent price sheet available    .  What sort of machine might $  ,    buy?  Or $   ,   ? What effects, what ranges might a million dollar machine be capable of?    The military certainly has that sort of money.    And they re certainly interested in this sort of technology, according to Michael Hutchison.  His interview with an informant named Joseph Light elicited some particularly provocative revelations.  According to Light:          There are important elements in the scientific community,       powerful people, who are very much interested in these areas...       but they have to keep most of their work secret.  Because as       soon as they start to publish some of these sensitive things,       they have problems in their lives.  You see, they work on        research grants, and if you follow the research being done,       you find that as soon as these scientists publish something       about this, their research funds are cut off.  There are areas       in bioelectric research  where very simple techniques and        devices can have mind boggling effects.  Conceivably, if you        have a crazed person with a bit of a technical background, he       can do a lot of damage    .    This last statement is particularly evocative.  In     , a violent neo NAZI group called The Order  responsible for the murder of talk show host Alan Berg  established contact with two government scientists engaged in clandestine research to project chemical imbalances and render targeted individuals docile via certain frequencies of electronic waves.  For $   ,    the scientists were willing to deliver this information    .    Thus, at least one group of crazed individuals almost got the goods. WAVE YOUR BRAIN GOODBYE    Every Senator and Congressional representative has a  wavie  file.  So do many state representatives.  Wavies have even pled their case to private institutions such as the Christic Institute    .    And who are the wavies?    They claim to be victims of clandestine bombardment with non ionizing radiation    or microwaves.  They report sudden changes in psychological states, alteration of sleep patterns, intracerebral voices and other sounds, and physiological effects.  Most people never realize how many wavies there are in this country.  I ve spoken to a number of wavies myself.    Are these troubled individuals seeking an exterior rationale for their mental problems?  Maybe.  Indeed, I m sure that such is the case in many instances.  But the fact is that the literature on the behavioral effects of microwaves, extra low frequencies  ELF  and ultra sonics is such that we cannot blithely dismiss ALL such claims.    For decades, American science and industry tried to convince the population that microwaves could have no adverse effects on human beings at sub thermal  levels    in other words, the attitude was,  If it can t burn you, it can t hurt you.   This approach became increasingly difficult to defend as reports mounted of microwave induced physiological effects.  Technicians described  hearing  certain radar installations; users of radar telescopes began developing cataracts at an appallingly high rate    .  The Soviets had long recognized the strange and sometimes subtle effects of these radio frequencies, which is why their exposure standards have always been much stricter.    Soviet microwave bombardment of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow prompted the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency s Project PANDORA  later renamed , whose ostensible goal was to determine whether these pulsations  reportedly    cycles per second, which puts them in the alpha range  could be used for the purposes of mind control.  I suspect that the  war on Tchaikowsky Street,  as I call it    , was used, at least in part, as a cover story for DARPA mind control research, and that the stories floated in the news  via, for example, Jack Anderson s column  about Soviet remote brainwashing served the same propaganda purposes as did the bleatings of Edward Hunter during the     s.        What can low level microwaves do to the mind?    According to a DIA report released under the Freedom of Information Act    , microwaves can induce metabolic changes, alter brain functions, and disrupt behavior patterns.  PANDORA discovered that pulsed microwaves can create leaks in the blood/brain barrier, induce heart seizures, and create behavioral disorganization    .  In     , a RAND Corporation scientist reported that  microwaves could be used to promote insomnia, fatigue, irritability, memory  loss, and hallucinations    .    Perhaps the most significant work in this area has been produced by Dr. W.  Ross Adey at the University of Southern California.  He determined that  behavior and emotional states can be altered without electrodes    simply by placing the subject in an electromagnetic field.  By directing a carrier frequency to stimulate the brain and using amplitude modulation to  shape  the wave into a mimicry of a desired EEG frequency, he was able to impose a  .  cps theta rhythm on his subjects    a frequency which he previously measured in the hippocampus during avoidance learning.  Thus, he could externally  condition the mind towards an aversive reaction    .   Adey has also done extensive work on the use of electrodes in animals    .   According to another prominent microwave scientist, Allen Frey, other frequencies could    in  animal studies    induce docility    .   cf USP # ,   ,    by Robert Monroe, METHOD OF INDUCING AND MAINTAINING VARIOUS STAGES OF SLEEP IN THE HUMAN BEING, granted    May     ; ABSTRACT:  A method of inducing sleep in the human being wherein an audio signal is generated comprising a familiar pleasing repetitive sound modulated by an EEG sleep pattern.   jpg     The controversial researcher Andrijah Puharich asserts that  a weak    mW    Hz magnetic sine wave will modify human brain waves in   to    seconds.  The psychological effects of a   Hz sine magnetic wave are negative    causing dizzyness, nausea, headache, and can lead to vomiting.   Conversely, an   Hz magnetic sine wave has beneficial effects    .  Though some writers question Puharich s integrity  perhaps correctly, considering his involvement in the confused tale of Uri Geller , his claims here seem in line with the findings of less flamboyant experimenters.    As investigative journalist Anne Keeler writes:          Specific frequencies at low intensities can predictably        influence sensory processes...pleasantness unpleasantness,       strain relaxation, and excitement quiescence can be created       with the fields.  Negative feelings and avoidance are strong       biological phenomena and relate to survival.  Feelings are       the true basis of much  decision making  and often occur as       subthreshold  i.e. subliminal  jpg  impressions...Ideas        INCLUDING NAMES  my italics   Cannon s italics  jpg  can be       synchronized with the feelings that the fields induce    .    Adey and compatriots have compiled an entire library of frequencies and pulsation rates which can affect the mind and nervous system.  Some of these effects can be extremely bizarre.  For example, engineer Tom Jarski, in an attempt to replicate the seminal work of F. Cazzamali, found that a particular frequency caused a ringing sensation in the ears of his subjects    who felt strangely compelled to BITE the experimenters!    .  On the other hand, the diet conscious may be intrigued by the finding that rats exposed to ELF waves failed to gain weight normally    .    For our present purposes, the most significant electromagnetic research  findings concern microwave signals modulated by hypnoidal EEG frequencies. Microwaves can act much like the  hemi synch  device previously described    that is, they can entrain the brain to theta rhythms    .  I need not emphasize the implications of remotely synchronizing the brain to resonate at a frequency conducive to sleep, or to hypnosis.    Trance may be remotely induced    but can it be directed?  Yes.  Recall the intracerebral voices mentioned earlier in our discussion of Delgado.  The same effect can be produced by  the wave.   Frey demonstrated in the early     s that microwaves could produce booming, hissing, buzzing, and other intra  cerebral static  this phenomenon is now called  the Frey effect  ; in     , Dr. Joseph Sharp, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, expanded on Frey s work in an experiment where the subject    in this case, Sharp himself    heard  and understood spoken words delivered via a pulsed microwave analog of the speaker s sound vibrations    .    Dr. Robert Becker comments that  Such a device has obvious applications in covert operations designed to drive a target crazy with  voices  or deliver undetectable instructions to a programmed assassin.       In other words, we now have, AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON, the technology either to inflict an electronic GASLIGHT    or to create a true MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Indeed, the former capability could effectively disguise the latter.  Who will listen to the victims, when electronically induced hallucinations they recount exactly parallel the classical signals of paranoid schizophrenia and/or temporal lobe epilepsy?    Perhaps the most ominous revelations, however, concern the mysterious work of J.F. Schapitz, who in      filed a plan to explore the interaction of  radio frequencies and hypnosis.  He proposed the following:          In this investigation it will be shown that the spoken        word of the hypnotist may be conveyed by modulated electro        magnetic energy DIRECTLY INTO THE SUBCONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE       HUMAN BRAIN  my italics     i.e., without employing any       technical devices for receiving or transcoding the messages       and without the person exposed to such influence having a        chance to control the information input consciously.    He outlined an experiment, innocent in its immediate effects yet chilling in its implications, whereby subjects would be implanted with the subconscious suggestion to leave the lab and buy a particular item; this action would be triggered by a certain cue word or action.  Schapitz felt certain that the subjects would rationalize the behavior    in other words, the subject would seize upon any excuse, however thin, to chalk up his actions to the working of free will    .  His instincts on this latter point coalesce perfectly with findings of professional hypnotists    .    Schapitz s work was funded by the Department of Defense.  Despite FOIA requests, the results have never been publicly revealed    . FINAL THOUGHTS ON  THE WAVE     I must again offer a caveat about possible disparities between the   official  record of electromagnetism s psychological effects and the hidden history.  Once more, we face a question of timing.  How long ago did this research REALLY begin?    In the eary years of this century, Nikola Tesla seems to have stumbled  upon certain of the behavioral effects of electromagnetic exposure    . Cazamalli, mentioned earlier, conducted his studies in the     s.  In     , E.L. Chaffe and R.U. Light published a paper on  A Method for the Remote  Control of Electrical Stimulation of the Nervous System.       From the very beginning of their work with microwaves, the Soviets explored the more subtle physiological effects of electromagnetism    and despite the bleatings of  certain right wing alarmists     that an  electromagnetic gap  separates us from Soviet advances, East European literature in this area has been closely monitored for decades by the West.  ARTICHOKE/BLUEBIRD project outlines,  dating from the early     s, prominently mention the need to explore all  possible uses of the electromagnetic spectrum.    Another point worth mentioning concerns the combination of EMR and miniature brain electrodes.  The father of the stimoceiver, Dr. J.M.R. Delgado, has recently conducted experiments in which monkeys are exposed to electromagnetic fields, thereby eliciting a wide range of behavioral effects    one monkey might fly into a volcanic rage while, just a few feet away, his simian partner begins to nod off.  Fascinatingly, when monkeys with brain implants felt  the wave,  the effects were greatly intensified.  Apparently, these tiny electrodes can act as AMPLIFIERS of the electromagnetic effect    .    ... Critics  might counter that any burst of microwave energy powerful enough to have truly remote effects would probably also create a thermal reaction.  That is, if a clandestine operator propagated a  wave  ... from a low flying helicopter, or from a truck travelling alongside the subject s car ... the power necessary to do the job might be such that the microwave would cook the target before it got a chance to launder his thoughts. ...    It s a fair criticism.  But Delgado s work may give us our solution. ... the chip in the brain would act an an intensifier of the signal.    Furthermore, recent reports indicate that a  waver  can achieve pinpoint accuracy without the use of Delgado style implants.  In     , volunteers at the Midwest Research Institute in Kansas City, Missouri, were exposed to microwave beams as part of an experiment sponsored by the Department of Energy and the New York State Department of Health.  As THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC     described the experiment,  A matched control group sat IN THE SAME ROOM without being bombarded by non ionizing radiation.   My italics.   Apparently, one can focus  the wave  quite narrowly ... .                               III. Applications    So we now have some idea of the tools available to the  spy chiatrists.  How have these tools been used?    This question necessarily involves some detective work.  The Central  Intelligence Agency, under duress, provided some, though not enough, documen  tation of its efforts to commandeer  the space between our ears.   We know that these efforts were extensive, long term, and at least partially successful.  We know also that these experiments used human subjects.  But who?  When?    One paradox of this line of inquiry is that, for many readers, the victims elicit sympathy only insofar as they remain anonymous.  Intellectually, we realize that MKULTRA and its allied projects must have affected hundreds,  probably thousands, of individuals.  Yet we react with deep suspicion  whenever one of these individuals steps forward and identifies himself, or whenever an independent investigator argues that mind control has directed some newsworthy person s otherwise inexplicable actions.  Where, the skeptic may rightfully ask, is the documentation supporting such accusations?  Most of the MKULTRA  paper trail  was  allegedly  burnt at Richard Helms  order; what s left has been censored, leaving black ink smudges wherever the names originally appeared.  Claimed mind control victims can, for the most part, only give us testimony    and how reliable can such testimony be, especially in light of the fact that one purpose of MKULTRA was to induce insanity?  Anyone asserting that he was victimized by the program might well be seeking an extrinsic excuse for his own psychopathology.  If you say that you are a manufactured madman, you were probably mad to begin with: Catch   .    When John Marks wrote THE SEARCH FOR  THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE  he received numerous letters from people insisting that they had been drugged,  waved,  or otherwise abused by the CIA or the military.  Most of these communications went directly into his crank file.  Perhaps many deserved that destination; I know  of at least one that did not    .    Marks did, however, devote much attention to Val Orlikov, a former  patient  of perhaps the most notorious figure in the annals of American medical crime: Dr. Ewen Cameron, a CIA funded scientist heading the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.  Cameron, a highly respected mental health researcher    , experimented with a technique he called  psychic driving,  a brainwashing program which involved inflicting upon a subject an endless tape loop blaring selected messages,    to    hours a day, combined with massive electroshock and LSD.  The project s  guinea pigs  were patients who had come to Allan Memorial with relatively minor psychological complaints. Cameron s experiments failed and his theories were discredited, which may explain why the CIA and its apologists now feel relatively comfortable  discussing the Frankensteinian efforts at Allan Memorial, as opposed to more successful work elsewhere.    Orlikov s testimony has received much respectful attention from those writers who have examined MKULTRA, and correctly so.  When I studied the files at the National Security Archives, I was particularly keen to read her original letters to John Marks, for these pages had led to the unmasking of an  especially heinous CIA project.  The letters, interestingly enough, proved just as vague, disjointed, and bizarre as similar correspondence which researchers routinely dismiss.  Orlikov can t be blamed for the hazy nature of her recollections; a certain amount of fog is to be expected, given the nature of the crime perpetrated against her.  The important point is that her story,  ultimately, was found to be true.  All of which leads me to wonder: Why did  HER claims prompt investigation when those of others prompt only dismissal?   Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that Orlikov s husband became a Canadian Member of Parliament.  Any victims of CIA experimentation who wish to be taken seriously ought, perhaps, first make sure to marry well.    Of course, we can easily forgive previous writers and readers whose researches into MKULTRA have been biased in favor of complacency    .  But we can t let this natural prejudice cripple our present investigation.  Let us  examine, then, a few of the  horror stories  from the mind control literature ... . PALLE HARDRUP S  GUARDIAN ANGEL     As mentioned previously, I have not delved much into the subject of hypnosis in this paper    primarily because of space and time limitations, but also  because discussions of the possibilities of hypnosis PER SE tend to cloud the issue of its use in conjunction with the above mentioned electronic techniques. Obviously, however, hypnosis is a major weapon in the mind controller s  armament; in a forthcoming full length work, I intend to deal with this subject at much greater length.    Needless to say, one of the primary objectives of MKULTRA and related  projects was to determine whether one could hypnotically induce someone to commit an anti social act.  This possibility remains one of the most hotly  debated issues in hypnosis, for conventional wisdom asserts that no individual can be hypnotized to commit an action which violates his interior moral code. Martin Orne, editor of the presitigious INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOSIS agrees with this axiom    , and he is in a position to codify much of the established view on this topic.  Orne, however, is a veteran of MKULTRA, and furthermore seems to have lied    at least in his original communications    to author John Marks about his witting involvement in subproject       .  While I respect much of Orne s ground breaking work, his pronouncements do not hold, for this layman, an Olympian unassailability.    To be sure, many other hypnosis experts, untainted by Company connections, also discount the possibility that anti social actions can be induced.  But a number of highly experienced professionals    including Milton Kline, William Kroger, George Estabrooks, John Watkins, and Herbert Spiegel    have argued  that such actions can, at least to some degree, be elicited by an outside manipulator.    Occasionally, claims of hypnotically induced anti social behavior find their way into the courtroom; one such case, which led to the incarceration of the hypnotist, was the Palle Hardrup affair.  This incident occurred in Denmark in         .  Palle Hardrup robbed a bank, killing a guard in the process, and later claimed that he had been instructed to do so by the  hypnotist Bjorn Nielsen.  Nielsen eventually confessed to having engineered  the crime as a test of his hypnotic abilities.    The most significant aspect of this incident concerns the  pose  Nielsen adopted to work his malicious designs.  During the hypnosis sessions, Nielsen hypnotically suggested that he was Hardrup s  guardian angel,  represented by the letter X.  Hardrup testified that  There is another room next door  where Nielsen and I go and talk on our own.  It is there that my guardian  spirit usually comes and talks to me.  Nielsen says that X has a task for me.     One of these tasks was arranging for Hardrup s girlfriend to have sex with the hypnotist.  The other tasks, he mentioned, included robbery and murder. Nielsen convinced his victim that  X  wanted the robbery funds to be used for worthwhile political goals.  The end, Hardrup was told, justified the means. ...    Thus we have one possible means of overcoming the proposition that hypnosis cannot induce anti social behavior.  If a hypnotist lacks scruples, and has access to a particularly susceptible subject, he can induce a MISPERCEIVED REALITY.  Actions which we would abhor in an everyday context become acceptable in specialized circumstances: A citizen who could never commit murder on a surburban street might, if drafted into an army, kill on the field of battle. In hypnosis, the mind becomes that battlefield.  In the words of Dr. John Watkins,          We behave on the basis of our perceptions.  If our perceptions       of a situation can be altered so as to cause us to misconstrue it,       or to develop a false belief, then our behavior in relation to it       will be drastically altered.  It is precisely in the area of        changing perceptions that the hypnotic modality demonstrates its       most powerful effects.  Hallucinations both under hypnosis, and       posthypnotic, can easily be induced in the suggestible subject.       He can be made to ignore painful stimuli, be apparently unable        to hear loud sounds, AND  SEE  INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT PRESENT        my italics .  Moreover, attitudes and beliefs can be initiated       in him which are quite abnormal and often contrary to those        which he previously held     .    If traditional hypnosis, unaided, can achieve such changes in perception, one can only imagine the possibilities inherent in the combination of hypnotic techniques with the psychoelectronic research previously described.    Scientists such as Orne and Milton Erickson      have taken issue with Watkins  assertions.  But the Hardrup case would appear to bear Watkins out. If someone can be convinced that he, like Jeanne D Arc, acts under the  influence of a supernatural higher power, then previously unthinkable  capabilitites may be evinced and  impossible  actions carried forth.  Indeed, when we consider the extreme personality changes    and occasionally, the heinous actions, elicited by leaders of certain cults, and occult groups     , we understand the desirability of installing a hypnotic  cover story  within a supernatural matrix.  People will do for God ... what they would not do otherwise.    The date of the Hardrup affair corresponds to the institution of BLUEBIRD/ ARTICHOKE; it doesn t require much imagination to see how this case could have served as a model to the scientists researching those and subsequent projects.     SCREEN MEMORY    According to declassified documents in the Marks files, a major difficulty faced by the MKULTRA researchers concerned the  disposal problem.   What to do with the victims of CIA sponsored electroshock, hypnosis, and drug experiment  ation?  The Company resorted to distressing, but characteristic, tactics: They disposed of their human guinea pigs by incarcerating them in insane asylums, by performing icepick lobotomies, and by ordering  executive actions.          A more sophisticated solution had to be found.  One of the goals of the  CIA s mind control efforts was the erasure of memory via hypnosis  and drugs, electronics, lobotomies, etc. ; not only would this hide what occurred during the experimental indoctrination/programming sessions, it would prove useful in the field.   Amnesia was a big goal,  confirms Victor Marchetti, who points out its usefulness in dealing with contract agents:  After you ve done it, the  agent doesn t even know what he s done...you send him in, he does the job.   When he comes out, you clean his head out.          The big problem: Despite hypnotically induced amnesia, there would be memory leaks    snippets of the repressed material would arise spontaneously, in dreams, as flashbacks, etc.  A proposed solution: Give the subject a  screen memory,  a false story; thus, even if he starts to recall the material, he will recall it incorrectly.    Even the conservative Dr. Orne notes that:          A S  subject  who is able to develop good posthypnotic amnesia       will also respond to suggestions to remember events which did not       actually occur.  On awakening, he will fail to recall the real       events of the trance and will instead recall the suggested events.       If anything, this phenomenon is easier to produce than total       amnesia, perhaps because it eliminates the subjective feeling of       an empty space in memory.         Not only would the screen memories fill in the uncomfortable blanks in the subjects  recollection, they would protect against revelation.  One fear of the MKULTRA scientists was that a hypno programmed individual used as, say, a courier, could be un programmed by another hypnotist, perhaps working for the enemy.  Thus, the MKULTRA scientists decided to instill multiple personalities    multiple cover stories, if you will    to confuse any  unauthorized  hypnotist.         One case using this technique centered on an assassin named Luis Castillo, who, after his capture in the Philippines, was extensively de briefed and studied by experts in the employ of the National Bureau of Investigation, that country s equivalent to our FBI.  Castillo was discovered to have had at least FOUR separate personalities hypnotically instilled; each personality could be triggered by a specific cue.  In one state, he claimed to be Sgt. Manuel Angel Ramirez, of the Strategic Air Tactical Command in South Vietnam; supposedly,  Ramirez  was the illegitimate son of a certain pipe smoking, highly placed CIA official whose initials were A.D.       Another personality claimed to be one of John F. Kennedy s assassins.    The main hypnotist involved with this case labelled these hypnotic alter  egos  Zombie states.   The report on the case stated that  The Zombie pheno  menon referred to here is a somnambulistic behavior displayed by the subject in a conditioned response to a series of words, phrases, and statements, apparently unknown to the subject during his normal waking state.     Upon Castillo s repatriation to the United States, the FBI claimed that he had fabricated the story.  In his book OPERATION MIND CONTROL, Walter Bowart makes a convincing case against the FBI s claims.  Certainly, many aspects of the Castillo affair argue for his sincerity    including his hypnotically  induced insensitivity to pain     , his maintenance of the story  or stories  even when severly inebriated, and his apparently programmed suicide attempts.    If Castillo told the truth, as I believe he did, then he manifested both hypnotically induced multiple personality and pseudomemory.  The former remains controversial; the latter has been repeatedly replicated in experimental situations     . THE SUPER SPY    Among the released BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE/MKULTRA papers was the following  handwritten memorandum, unsigned and undated:          I have developed a technic which is safe and secure  free       from international censorship .  It has to do with the       conditioning of our own people.  I can accomplish this as a       one man job.          The method is the production of hypnosis by means of        simple oral medication.  Then  with NO further medication         the hypnosis is re enforced daily during the following three       or four days.          Each individual is conditioned against revealing any       information to an enemy, even though subjected to hypnosis       or drugging.  If preferable, he may be conditioned to give        FALSE information rather than NO information.    In the margin of this document, one of Marks  assistants wrote,  Is this Wendt?   The reference here is to G. Richard Wendt, a professor  employed by project CHATTER who, in     , led both his Naval employers and the CIA on a mind control merry goose chase, when an experiment similar to that described above failed to produce results     .  Even if the above memorandum DOES describe an operational failure  and the tactics described in this memo do not seem very feasible to me , we should not rest complacent.  We now know  that, in at least ONE case, more sophisticated techniques made the above scenario a reality.    I refer to the case of Candy Jones.    Her story has filled at least one book      and ought, one day, to give rise to another.  Obviously, I cannot here give all the details of this fascinating and frightening narrative.  But a precis is mandatory.    Ms. Jones  born Jessica Wilcox  achieved star status as a model during  World War II, and later established her own modelling agency.  An FBI man  requested her to allow her place of business to be used as a  mail drop  for the Bureau and  another government agency   presumably, the CIA ; Candy, deeply patriotic, accepted the proposition gladly.  Toiling on the fringes of the  clandestine world, Candy eventually came into contact with a  Dr. Gilbert Jensen,  who worked, in turn, with a  Dr. Marshall Burger.    Both names are pseudonyms.   Unknown to her, these doctors had been employed as  spy  chiatrists  by the CIA.  Using a job interview as a cover, Jensen induced  hypnosis, found Candy to be a particularly responsive subject    and proceeded to use her as other scientists would use a rhesus monkey.  She became a test subject for the CIA s mind control program.    Her job    insofar as it is known    was to provide a clandestine courier service     .  Estabrooks had outlined the basic idea years earlier: Induce hypnosis via a disguised technique, give the messenger information to  memorize, hypnotically  erase  the message from conscious memory, and install a post hypnotic suggestion that the message  now buried within the sub  conscious  will be brought forth only upon a specific cue.  If the hypnotist can create such a courier, ultra security can be guaranteed; even torture won t cause the messenger to tell what he knows    because he doesn t know that he  knows it     .  According to the highly respected Dr. Milton Kline,  Evidence really does exist that has not been published  proving that Estabrooks  perfect secret agent could be successfully evoked     .    Candy was one such success story.  Success, in this context, means that she could be    and was    brutally tortured and abused while running assignments for the CIA.  All the MKULTRA toys were brought into play: hypnosis, drugs, conditioning    and electronics.  Using these devices, Jensen and Burger  managed to:    install a  duplicate personality,     create amnesia of both the programming sessions and the field assignments,    turn Candy into a vicious, hate mongering bigot, the better to isolate her    from the rest of humanity  previously, her associates considered her     noteworthy for her racial tolerance; her modelling agency was one of the    first to break the color barrier , and    program her to commit suicide at the end of her usefulness to the Agency.    The programming techniques used on her were flawed.  She breached security when she married famed New York radio personality John Nebel, who, using hypnotic regression, elicited the long repressed truth.  Eventually, the  Other Candy  was bade farewell, and the programming broken.    ... I feel that the veracity of her narrative has been established beyond reasonable doubt.  In her hypnotic regression sessions, she recalled being programmed at a government connected institute in northern California    which, as John Marks  investigators later proved, was indeed heavily involved with government funded brainwashing research     .  Marks himself believes Candy s story    not least, because the details of the programming methods used on her were substantiated by documents released AFTER her book was published     .  Interviews with Milton Kline, Dr. Frances Jakes, John Watkins and others provided the testimony that the programming of Candy Jones was feasible    and Deep Trance substantiated the story     .    Recently, the case has received important  indirect  confirmation:  Investigators interested in follow up research have filed FOIA requests with  the CIA for all papers relating to Candy Jones.  The agency admits that it has a substantial file on her, but refuses to release any part of it.  If her tale is false, then why would the CIA be so reluctant to deliver the information? Indeed, why would they have a file in the first place?         The final confirmation of Candy s tale requires a revelation    one which I make with some trepidation, even though the individual named is dead.     Marshall Burger  was really Dr. William Kroger     .    Kroger, long associated with the espionage establishment, had written the following in     :          ...a good subject can be hypnotized to deliver secret       information.  The memory of this message could be covered       by an artificially induced amnesia.  In the event that he       should be captured, he naturally could not remember that he        had ever been given the message...however, since he had        been given a post hypnotic suggestion, the message would be       subject to recall through a specific cue.         If Candy confabulated her story, why did she name this particualr scientist, who, writing theoretically in     , predicted the subsequent events in her  life?                                                                         After L AFFAIR JONES, Kroger transferred his base of operations to UCLA    specifically, to the Neuropsychiatric Institute run by Dr. Louis Jolyon West, an MKULTRA veteran.  There he wrote HYPNOSIS AND BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION     , with a preface by Martin Orne  another MKULTRA veteran  and H.J. Eysenck  still another MKULTRA veteran .  The finale of this opus contains chilling hints of the possibilites inherent in combining hypnosis with ESB, implants, and conditioning    though Kroger is careful to point out that  we are not  concerned that man might be conditioned by rewards and punishments through electronic brain stimulation to be controlled like robots.        HE may not be concerned    but perhaps WE ought to be.  ... Because the Controllers did not establish a hypnotic cover story, or pseudomemory, the true facts of the case managed to percolate into her conscious mind.  No matter how thorough the post  hypnotic amnesia, leaks will occur    hence the need for a false memory, to  fill the gap of recollection.  The CIA learns from its mistakes. ...  Milton Kline accepted the Candy Jones story, but considered the job amateurish and inconsistent with the best work done at that time     .  Perhaps the major  fault was the lack of a pseudomemory cover story?  ...the story of Dr. Louis Jolyon West, now notorious for his participation in MKULTRA experiments with LSD     .  Inspired by VIOLENCE AND THE BRAIN  a book by Drs. Frank Ervin and Vernon H. Mark which ascribed inner city turmoil to a  genetic defect  within rebellious blacks , West proposed, in     , a Center for the Study and Reduction of  Violence, where potentially violent individuals could be dealt with  prophylactically.    And who were these individuals?  According to West s proposal, the note  worthy factors indicating a violent predisposition were  sex  male , age  youthful , ethnicity  black  and urbanicity.   How to deal with them?   ...by implanting tiny electrodes deep within the brain, electrical activity can be followed in areas that cannot be measured from the surface of the scalp...it is even possible to record bioelectrical changes in the brains of freely moving subjects, through the use of remote monitoring techniques...   By monitoring  the subjects  EEGs remotely, potentially violent episodes could be identified. THE SCANDINAVIAN CONNECTION    Two cases in point: Martti Koski and Robert Naeslund.    Koski, a Finnish citizen, claims to have been a victim of mind control  experimentation while visiting Canada.  Shortly after his experience began, he attempted to broadcast his situation to the world and draw attention to his plight.  Few listened.  Many of his details were bizarre, and not being a native speaker of English, he could not express himself convincingly to those he approached for help.  Yet many aspects of his story correspond closely to known details of MKULTRA and related programs.    Naeslund, a Swedish citizen, tells a similar story.  Moreover, his claims were backed by special evidence: X rays revealed an implant in his brain.   Naeslund actually went to the extreme of having his implant tested by  electronic technicians employed by Hewlett Packard.  A Greek surgeon performed the necessary trepanation to remove the device. ...    Naeslund s implant was originally placed through his nasal cavity.  He first realized that something terrible had happened to him after an experience of missing time, followed by an INEXPLICABLE NOSEBLEED.    I have located a reference in the open literature to the use, in animal study, of nasally implanted electrodes for the measurement of electro  magnetic radiation effects     .    There are other claimed mind control victims bearing evidence of implants; note, especially, the fascinating case of James Petit, a CIA connected pilot and alleged brainwashing alumnus ... .       HELICOPTERS AND DISKS    The bizarre story of Rex Niles and his sister  not named in news accounts  ... Niles, the high rolling owner of a Woodland Hills defense subcontracting firm  Rex Rep  was fingered by authorities  investigating defense industry kickbacks.  He became an extraordinarily cooperative witness in the investigation    until he was targeted by his enemies, who allegedly used psychoelectronics as harassment.    The following excerpt from  a  LOS ANGELES TIMES article       on Niles is particularly compelling:          He  Niles  produced testimony from his sister, a Simi       Valley woman who swears that helicopters have repeatedly       circled her home.  An engineer measured     watts of       microwaves in the atmosphere outside Niles  house and       found a RADIOACTIVE DISK UNDERNEATH THE DASH OF HIS CAR        my italics .            A former high school friend, Lyn Silverman, claimed       that her home computer went haywire when Niles stepped       close to it. ...    As former FBI agent Ted Gunderson recently explained to my associate Alexander Constantine, magnetic radioactive discs have long been used by the clandestine services as cancer inducing  silent killers     i.e., as tools of assassination. THE MILITARY AND MIND CONTROL    Some time ago, I attended hypnotic regression sessions in which the  subject ... recalled undergoing a mysterious  brain operation  at a veteran s hospital in California. ... this same hospital was mentioned in two other cases I encountered.    One of these claimants, a former Navy SEAL who undertook numerous dangerous missions in Vietnam, favorably impressed me with the wealth of detail in his story     .  This individual    I ve taken to calling him  the trained SEAL    had received specialized combat training at a military base in California; he claims that at one point during this training he was drugged, hypnotized,  possibly placed under some form of electronic control, and subjected to the extremes of pain/pleasure operant conditioning.  One peculiar detail of his story concerns the  reward  aspect of the conditioning: When properly  acquiescent, he was given unlimited sexual access to a woman who, the SEAL  avers, was herself the victim of brainwashing.    Unbelievable as this last claim may seem, I found it oddly resonant when I later interviewed a  Southern California woman , who bravely offered me details on a puzzling, albeit quite delicate, incident in her past.  Still an attractive woman, she recalled for me    indeed, seemed strangely compelled to describe    an early love affair with a young soldier training at a military base near her home.  She cannot recall the soldier s  name.  All she remembers is that one day he started LIVING AT HER FAMILY S HOUSE; she has no memory of how the arrangement began, and her parents have never felt comfortable discussing the matter.  Although unattracted to this soldier, she felt compelled to become intimate with him, adopting a pliant, obeisant attitude that was quite out of character for her.  Later, the soldier went on to covert missions in Vietnam.    Of course, a young person s psycho sexual development is never smooth, and the incident related above may merely have represented one peculiarly upsetting bump in that notoriously rough road.  Still, some of the details of this story    particularly the parents  attitude, the woman s personality shift, and her subsequent memory lapses    are striking, and I treat with respect  her  intuition that this minor enigma in her personal history could, if properly understood, shed light on her later  missing time  experiences.    Could the  trained SEAL  have been right?  Was there, IS there, a coterie of hypno programmed soldiers conducting particularly hazardous missions?  And do the programmers have at their disposal a  ladies  auxiliary,  so to speak, of hypnotized camp followers?    If the SEAL s story stood alone, skeptics could easily dismiss it  provided they did not sit, as I did, face to face with the story s teller, listening to all the grisly and unsettling details .  But other veterans have added their voices to this grim tale.  Daniel Sheehan, of the Christic Institute, claims that his organization has spoken to half a dozen individuals with narratives similar to my SEAL informant.  All had received  processing,  so to speak, within the context of standard military training; after pro  gramming and specialized combat instruction by mercenaries, the recruits were placed  on hold,  to be used as situations arose    and some of those  situations occurred within the United States     .    Walter Bowart began his own researches into mind control by placing an ad in SOLDIER OF FORTUNE style publications, asking for correspondence from veterans who experienced inexplicable lapses in memory or strange behavior modification techniques while serving in Vietnam; he received over     replies.  Bowart  devoted an entire chapter to one of these respondents    an Air Force veteran named David, who ended his four year tour of duty recalling only that he had spent the time  having fun, skin diving, laying on the beach, collecting shells...It never dawned on me until later that I must have DONE something while I was in the service.    An obvious example of screen memory.   He was also  assigned  a girlfriend whose name he cannot now recall, despite the  length and deep intimacy of the affair     . ...    We even have a confession, of sorts, from a scientist who specialized in one aspect of this sort of training.  Lt. Commander Thomas Narut, of the U.S. Naval Hospital at the NATO headquarters in Naples, Florida, admitted during a lecture in Oslo that recruits in Naples underwent CLOCKWORK ORANGE  style behavior modification sessions.  Trainees would be strapped into chairs with their eyelids clamped open while watching films of industrial accidents and African circumcision ceremonies    films frequently used by psychologists as a means of inducing stress in experimental situations.  Unlike the protagonist in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, who learned revulsion at the sight of violence, Narut s soldiers were taught to accept and enjoy bloodshed, to view it with equanimity.  Similar techniques were used to dehumanize potential enemies.  Graduates of this program became, in Narut s words,  hit men and assassins,  to be placed in American embassies throughout the world.    When questioned by reporters about these claims, the American government denied the story; Narut    after a long incommunicado period and apparent  coercion    later explained to journalists that he had merely spoken  theoretically.  If so, why did he originally describe the behavior modification procedure as an ongoing program?      ...    Narut, of course, concentrated on selective programming of individual American soldiers; on the other side of the mind control spectrum, Defense Department specialists have also concentrated on methods to render entire enemy battalions  combat ineffective.   Electromagnetic weaponry, intended to wipe out the aggression of the enemy, is the province of DARPA, under the direction of Dr. Jack Verona.  These projects remain fairly mysterious; we do know, however, that one operation, SLEEPING BEAUTY, employed the services of Dr. Michael Persinger ... .    Persinger discovered a method of using ELF waves to induce the brain s MAST cells to release histamine; should a battlefield commander wish to subject his enemy to mass bouts of vomiting, Persinger s trick could do the job even  faster than a Tobe Hooper movie.  The method works on animals.   The question,  writes mind control researcher Larry Collins,  is how to get from point A to point B without violating one of the most rigorous commandments of Government ethics    thou shalt not conduct experiments like that on human beings.          If Collins had studied the record a little more carefully, he might realize that the government hasn t always regarded this commandment as something  graven in stone.  As Milton Kline put it:          Ethical factors involved in most research would preclude       having positive results.  Those ethical factors don t always       hold with government research.  THE RESEARCH WHICH HAS GIVEN        REALLY POSITIVE RESULTS HAS NOT BEEN LIMITED BY ETHICAL       CONSTRAINTS     .   my italics  THE ULTIMATE MOTIVE FOR MIND CONTROL                             Hypnosis hard liners of the Orne school would almost certainly dismiss the foregoing veterans  accounts of the use of hypnosis, drugs and behavioral conditioning on American fighting men.  Why, the skeptics would ask, would anyone attempt to create a  Manchurian Candidate  when the military services, using entirely conventional means, can create a  Rambo ?  There have always been recruits for even the most hazardous duties; what need of hypnosis?    The need, in fact, is absolute.    The modern battlefield has little place for the traditional soldier.   Advanced weaponry requires an increasing level of technical sophistication, which in turn requires a cool headed operator.  But the all too human combatant    though capable of extraordinary acts of courage under the most  stressful conditions imaginable    does not possess inexhaustible reserves of SANG FROID.  Eventually, breakdowns will occur.  Per capita psychiatric  casualties have increased dramatically in each successive American conflict. As Richard Gabriel, the excellent historian of the role of psychiatry in warfare, writes:          Modern warfare has become so lethal and so intense that        only the already insane can endure it...Modern war requiring        continuous combat will increase the degree of fatigue on the       soldier to heretofore unknown levels.  Physical fatigue          especially the lack of sleep    will increase the rate of       psychiatric casualties enormously.  Other factors    high       rates of indirect fire, night fighting, lack of food, constant       stress, large numbers of casualties    will ensure that the       number of psychiatric casualties will reach disastrous pro        portions.  And the number of casualties will overburden the       medical structure to the point of collapse.          The ability to treat psychiatric casualties will all but       disappear.  There will be no safe forward areas in which to        treat soldiers debilitated by mental collapse.  The technology       of modern war has made such locations functionally obsolete...         According to Gabriel, the military intends to meet this challenge by creating  the chemical soldier,  a designer drugged zombie in fighting man s uniform:          On the battlefields of the future we will witness a true       clash of ignorant armies, armies ignorant of their own        emotions and even of the reasons for which they fight.       Soldiers on all sides will be reduced to fearless chemical       automatons who fight simply because they can do nothing       else...Once the chemical genie is out of the bottle, the       full range of human mental and physical actions become       targets for chemical control...Today it is already possible       by chemical or electrical stimulation to increase the       aggression levels of the human being by stimulating the       amygdala, a section of the brain known to control aggression       and rage.  Such  human potential engineering  is already a       partial reality and the necessary technical knowledge        increases every day     .    While this passage speaks of drugs and electronics, we can safely assume  that the planners of battle would not refrain from using any other promising technique.    Gabriel writes primarily of large scale battle scenarios, but based on his information, we can fairly deduce that the mind controlled soldier will also play a role in the surgical strike, the covert operation, the infiltration behind enemy lines by units of the Special Forces.  On such missions, United States personnel have increasingly relied on torture as a means of interro  gation and intimidation     , and as such barbarism becomes standard procedure the American fighting man of the future will need to find within himself unprecedented reserves of brutality.  Will the average recruit, culled from the nation s suburbs and reared on traditional ideals, possess such reserves?    Vietnam proved that the soldier, despite a barrage of propaganda intended to cloud his discernment, will sense the difference between fighting for legit  imate defense interests and fighting to protect political hegemony.  To  forestall this realization, or to render it irrelevant, military planners must withdraw the human combatant and replace him with a new species of warrior. The soldier of the future will not discern; he will merely do.  He will not be a butcher; he will be the butcher s KNIFE    a tool among tools, thoughtless and effective.    And it is my contention that to create this soldier of the future, the controllers will need a continuing program, one designed to test each new method and combination of methods for conquering the human mind.    One primary goal of this program must include expanding the human capacity for stress and violence.  Subjects enrolled in such experimental procedures will experience pain, and will learn to accept the pain.  Eventually, they will learn to inflict it, without remorse or even remembrance.  The nation who first creates this new soldier will possess a decisive advantage on the  conven  tional  battlefield    as will the nation which first develops a means of using mass mind control techniques to disable entire enemy platoons.   And to placate whole civilian populations, both those of the enemy and those at home.   jpg  This paramount military necessity is the reason why I will never believe any unconvincing reassurances that our nation s clandestine scientists have fore  gone or will forego research into behavior modification.  This research will never be mere history.  What s past is present, and today s covert experiment  ation will become tomorrow s basic training.    A prototype of the future warrior may already be with us.  The Navy SEAL I interviewed spoke in horrifying detail of dismemberment without emotion, of rape as routine, of killing without affect.  And then FORGETTING THAT HE HAD KILLED.  Even years later, he could not recall the stories behind many of the wounds on his own body.  He claims that whenever he would need the services of the veteran s hospital, doctors would re hypnotize him shortly after his  admission, while a physician specifically cleared for such work would examine his medical history, which was highly classified and kept under lock and key.    According to the SEAL s testimony, his memory block cracked little by  little, as a result of events too complex to recount here.  Finally, years  after Vietnam, he was able to remember what he did.    Amnesia was a blessing.  Reality forever eludes us.  Infinity mocks our puny efforts to imprison it in definition and dogma.  Our most splendid realizations are only adumbrations of the Light.  In his endeavors, man is but a mollusk seeking to encompass the ocean. Yet man may not cease his struggle to find God.  There is a yearning in his soul that will not let him rest, an urge that compels him to attempt the impossible, to attain the unattainable. He lifts feeble hands to grasp the stars and despite a million years of failure and millenniums of disappointment, the soul of man springs heavenward with even greater avidity than when the race was young. He pursues, even though the flying ideal eternally slips from his embrace.  Even though he never clasps the goddess of his dreams, he refuses to believe that she is a phantom.  To him she is the only reality.  He reaches upward and will not be content until the sword of Orion is in his hands, and glorious Arcturus glearns from his breast. Man is Parsifal searching for the Sacred Cup; Sir Launfal adventuring for the Holy Grail.  Life is a divine adventure, a splendid quest Language falls.  Words are mere cyphers, and who can read the riddle? These words we use, what are they but vain shadows of form and sense? We strive to clothe our highest thought with verbal trappings that our brother may see and understand; and when we would describe a saint he sees a demon; and when we would present a wise man he beholds a fool.   Fie upon you,  he cries;  thou, too, art a fool.        So wisdom drapes her truth with symbolism, and covers her insight with allegory.  Creeds, rituals, poems are parables and symbols. The ignorant take them literally and build for themselves prison houses of words and with bitter speech and bitterer taunt denounce those who will not join them in the dungeon.  Before the rapt vision of the seer, dogma and ceremony, legend and trope dissolve and fade, and he sees behind the fact the truth, behind the symbol the Reality. Through the shadow shines ever the Perfect Light. What is a Mason? He is a man who in his heart has been duly and truly prepared, has been found worthy and well qualified, has been admitted to the fraternity of builders, been invested with certain passwords and signs by which he may be enabled to work and receive wages as a Master Mason, and travel in foreign lands in search of that which was lost   The Word. Down through the misty vistas of the ages rings a clarion declaration and although the very heavens echo to the reverberations, but few hear and fewer understand:  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.  Here then is the eternal paradox.  The Word is lost yet it is ever with us.  The light that illumines the distant horizon shines in our hearts.  Thou wouldist not seek me hadst thou not found me.  We travel afar only to find that which we hunger for at home. And as Victor Hugo says:  The thirst for the Infinite proves infinity.  That which we seek lives in our souls. This, the unspeakable truth, the unutterable perfection, the author has set before us in these pages.  Not a Mason himself, he has read the deeper meaning of the ritual.  Not having assumed the formal obligations, he calls upon all mankind to enter into the holy of holies.  Not initiated into the physical craft, he declares the secret doctrine that all may hear.       With vivid allegory and profound philosophical disquisition he expounds the sublime teachings of Freemasonry, older than all religions, as universal as human aspiration. It is well.  Blessed are the eyes that see, and the ears that hear, and the heart that understands.   INTRODUCTION Freemasonry, though not a religion, is essentially religious.  Most of its legends and allegories are of a sacred nature; much of it is woven into the structure of Christianity.  We have learned to consider our own religion as the only inspired one, and this probably accounts for much of the misunderstanding in the world today concerning the place occupied by Freemasonry in the spiritual ethics of our race.  A religion is a divinely inspired code of morals.  A religious person is one inspired to nobler livi ng by this code.  He is identified by the code which is his source of illumination.  Thus we may say that a Christian is one who receives his spiritual ideals of right and wrong from the message of the Christ, while a Buddhist is one who molds his life into the archetype of morality given by the great Gautama, or one of the other Buddhas.  All doctrines which seek to unfold and preserve that invisible spark in man named Spirit, are said to be spirit ual.  Those which ignore this invisible element and concent rate entirely upon the visible are said to be material.  There is in religion a wonderful point of balance, where the materialist and spiritist meet on the plane of logic and reason.  Science and theology are two ends of a single truth, but the world will never receive the full benefit of their investigations until they have made peace with each other, and labor hand in hand for the accomplishment of the great work   the liberation of spirit and in telligence from the three dimensional prison house of ignora nce, superstition, and fear. That which gives man a knowledge of himself can be inspired only by the Self   and God is the Self in all things. In truth, He is the inspiration and the thing inspired.  It has been stated in Scripture that God was the Word and that the Word was made flesh.  Man s task now is to make flesh reflect the glory of that Word, which is within the soul of himself.  It is this task which has created the need of religion   not one faith alone but many creeds, each searching in its own way, e ach meeting the needs of individual people, each emphasizing one point above all the others. Twelve Fellow Craftsmen are exploring the four points of the compass.  Are not these twelve the twelve great world religions, each seeking in its own way for that which was lost in the ages past, and the quest of which is the birthright of man? Is not the quest for Reality in a world of illusions the task for which each comes into the world? We are here to gain balance in a sphere of unbalance; to find rest in a restless thing; to unveil illusion; and to slay the dragon of our own animal natures.  As David, King of Israel, gave to the hands of his son Solomon the task he could not accomplish, so each generation gives to the next the work of building the temple, or rather, rebuilding the dwelling of the Lord, which is on Mount Moriah. Truth is not lost, yet it must be sought for and found.  Reality is ever present   dimensionless yet all prevailing. Man   creature of attitudes and desires, and servant of impressions and opinions   cannot, with the wavering unbalance of an untutored mind, learn to know that which he himself does not possess.  As man attains a quality, he discovers that quality, and recognizes about him the thing newborn within himself.  Man is born with eyes, yet only after long years of sorrow does he learn to see clearl y and in harmony with the Plan.  He is born with senses, but only after long experience and fruitless strivings does he bring these senses to the temple and lays them as offerings upon the altar of the great Father, who alone does all things well and with understanding.  Man is, in truth, born in the sin of ignorance, but with a capacity for understanding.  He has a mind capable of wisdom, a heart capable of feeling, and a hand strong for the great work in life   truing the rough ashlar into the perfect sto ne. What more can any creature ask than the opportunity to prove the thing he is, the dream that inspires him, the vision that leads him on? We have no right to ask for wisdom.  In whose name do we beg for understanding? By what authority do we demand happiness? None of these things is the birthright of any creature; yet all may have them, if they will cultivate within themselves the thing that they desire.  There is no need of asking, nor does any Deity bow down to give man these things that he desires.  Man i s given by Nature, a gift, and that gift is the privilege of labor.  Through labor he learns all things. Religions are groups of people, gathered together in the labor of learning.  The world is a school.  We are here to learn, and our presence here proves our need of instruction.  Every living creature is struggling to break the strangling bonds of limitation   that pressing narrowness which inhabits vision and leaves the life without an ideal.  Every soul is engaged in a great work   the labor of personal liberation from the state of ignorance.  The world is a great prison; its bars are the Unknown.  And eac h is a prisoner until, at last, he earns the right to tear these bars from their moldering sockets, and pass, illuminated and inspired, into the darkness, which becomes lighted by that presence.  All peoples seek the temple where God dwells, where the spirit of the great Truth illuminates the shadows of human ignorance, but they know not which way to turn nor where this temple is. The mist of dogma surrounds them.  Ages of thoughtlessness bind them in.  Limitation weakens them and retards their footsteps. They wander in darkness seeking light, failing to realize that the Eght is in the heart of the darkness. To the few who have found Him, God is revealed.  These, in turn, reveal Him to man, striving to tell ignorance the message of wisdom.  But seldom does man understand the mystery that has been unveiled.  He tries weakly to follow in the steps of those who have attained, but all too often finds the path more difficult than he even dreamed.  So he kneels in prayer before the mountain he cannot climb, from whose top gleams the light which he is neither strong enough to reach nor wise enough to comprehend.  He l ives the law as he knows it, always fearing in his heart that he has not read aright the flaming letters in the sky, and that in living the letter of the Law he has murdered the spirit.  Man bows humbly to the Unknown, peopling the shadows of his own ignorance with saints and saviors, ghosts and spectres, gods and demons.  Ignorance fears all things, falling, terror stricken before the passing wind. Superstition stands as the monument to ignorance, and b efore it kneel all who realize their own weakness; wh o see in all things the strength they do not possess; who give to sticks and stones the power to bruise them; who change the beauties of Nature into the dwelling place of ghouls and ogres.  Wisdom fears no thing, but still bows humbly to its own Source.  While superstition hates all things, wisdom, with its deeper understanding, loves all things; for it has seen the beauty, the tenderness, and the sweetness which underlie Life s mystery. Life is the span of time appointed for accomplishment.  Every fleeting moment is an opportunity, and those who are great are the ones who have recognized life as the opportunity for all things. Arts, sciences, and religions are monuments standing for what humanity has already accomplished.  They stand as memorials to the unfolding mind of man, and through them man acquires more efficient and more intelligent methods of attaining prescribed results. Blessed are those who can profit by the experiences of ot hers; who, adding to that which has already been built, can make their inspiration real, their dreams practical.  Those who give man the things he needs, while seldom appreciated in their own age, are later recognized as the Saviors of the human race.       Masonry is a structure built upon experience.  Each stone is a sequential step in the unfolding of intelligence.  The shrines of Masonry are ornamented by the jewels of a thousand ages; its rituals ring with the words of enlightened seers and illuminated sages.  A hundred religions have brought their gifts of wisdom to its altar.  Arts and sciences unnumbered have contributed to its symbolism.  It is more than a faith; it is a path of certainty.  It is more than a belief; it is a fact.  Masonry is a univers ity, teaching the liberal arts and sciences of the soul to all who will attend to its words.  It is a shadow of the great Atlantean Mystery School, which stood with all its splendor in the ancient City of the Golden Gates, where now the turbulent Atlantic rolls in unbroken sweep.  Its chairs are seats of learning; its pillars uphold the arch of universal education, not only in material things, but also in those qualities which are of the spirit.  Up on its trestleboards are inscribed the sacred truths of all nations and of all peoples, and upon those who understand its sacred depths has dawned the great Reality.  Masonry is, in truth, that long lost thing which all peoples have sought in all ages.  Masonry is the common denominator as well as the common devisor of human aspiration. Most of the religions of the world are like processions: one leads, and the many follow.  In the footsteps of the demigods, man follows in his search for truth and illumination.  The Christian follows the gentle Nazarene up the winding slopes of Calvary.  The Buddhist follows his great emancipator through his wanderings in the wilderness.  The Mohammedan makes his pilgrimage across the desert sands to the black tent at Mecca.  Truth leads, and ignorance follows in his train.  Spirit blazes the trail, and ma tter follows behind.  In the world today ideals live but a moment in their purity, before the gathering hosts of darkness snuff out the gleaming spark.  The Mystery School, however, remains unmoved.  It does not bring its light to man; man must bring his light to it. Ideals, coming into the world, become idols within a few short hours, but man, entering the gates of the sanctuary, changes the idol back to an ideal. Man is climbing an endless flight of steps, with his eyes fixed upon the goal at the top.  Many cannot see the goal, and only one or two steps are visible before them.  He has learned, however, one great lesson   namely, that as he builds his own character he is given strength to climb the steps.  Hence a Mason is a builder of the temple of character.  He is the architect of a sublime mystery   the gleaming, glowing temple of his own soul.  He realizes that he best serves God when he joins with the Great Ar chitect in building more noble structures in the universe below.  All who are attempting to attain mastery through constructive efforts are Masons at heart, regardless of religious sect or belief.  A Mason is not necessarily a member of a lodge.  In a broad sense, he is any person who daily tries to live the Masonic life, and to serve intelligently the needs of the Great Architect.  The Masonic brother pledges himself to assist all other temple builders in whatever extremity of life; and in so doing he pled ges himself to every living thing, for they are all temple builders, building more noble structures to the glory of the universal God. The true Masonic Lodge is a Mystery School, a place where candidates are taken out of the follies and foibles of the world and instructed in the mysteries of life, relationships, and the identity of that germ of spiritual essence within, which is, in truth, the Son of God, beloved of His Father.  The Mason views life seriously, realizing that every wasted moment is a lost opportunity, and that Omnipotence is gained only through earnestness and endeavor.  Above all other relationships he recognizes the unive rsal brotherhood of every living thing.  The symbol of the clasped hands, explained in the Lodge, reflects his attitude towards all the world, for he is the comrade of all created things.  He realizes also that his spirit is a glowing, gleaming jewel which he must enshrine within a holy temple built by the labor of his hands, the meditation of his heart, and the aspiration of his soul.       Freemasonry is a philosophy which is essentially creedless.  It is the truer for it.  Its brothers bow to truth regardless of the bearer; they serve light, instead of wrangling over the one who brings it.  In this way they prove that they are seeking to know better the will and the dictates of the Invincible One.  No truer religion exists than that of world comradeship and brotherhood, for the purpose of glorifying one God and building for Him a temple of constructive attitude and noble character. PROLOGUE IN THE FIELDS OF CHAOS The first flush of awakening Life pierced the impenetrable expanse of Cosmic Night, turning the darkness of negation into the dim twilight of unfolding being.  Silhouetted against the shadowy gateways of Eternity, the lonely figure of a mystic stranger stood upon the nebulous banks of swirling substance.  Robed in a shimmery blue mantle of mystery and his head encircled by a golden crown of dazzling light, the darkness of Chaos fled before the rays that poured like streams of living fire from his form divin e. From some Cosmos greater far than ours this mystic visitor came, answering the call of Divinity.  From star to star he strode and from world to universe he was known, yet forever concealed by the filmy garments of chaotic night.  Suddenly the clouds broke and a wondrous light descended from somewhere among the seething waves of force; it bathed this lonely form in a radiance celestial, each sparkling crystal of mist gleaming like a diamond bathed in the living fire of the Divine. In the gleaming flame of cosmic light bordered by the dark clouds of not being two great forms appeared and a mighty Voice thrilled eternity, each sparkling atom pulsating with the power of the Creator s Word* while the great blue robed figure bowed in awe before the foot stool of His Maker as a hand reached down from heaven, its fingers extended the benediction.  Of all creation I have chosen you and upon you my seal is placed. You are the chosen instrument of my hand and I appoint you to be the Builder of my Temple.  You shall raise its pillars and tile its floor; you shall ornament it with metals and with jewels and you shall be the master of my workmen.  In your hands I place the plans and here on the tracing board of livig substance I have impressed the plan you are to follow, tracing its every letter and angle in the fiery lines of my moving finger.  Hiram Ab iff, chosen builder of your Father s house, up and to your work.  Yonder are the fleecy clouds, the * The Creative Fiat, or rate of vibration through which all things are created. gray mists of dawn, the gleams of heavenly light, and the darkness of the sleep of creation. From these shall you build, without the sound of hammer or the voice of workmen, the temple of your God, eternal in the heavens.  The swirling, ceaseless motion of negation you shall chain to grind your stones.  Among these spirits of not being shall you slack your lime and lay your footings; for I have watched you through the years of your youth; I have guided you through the days of your manhood.  I have weighed y ou in the balance and you have not been found wanting.  Therefore, to you give I the glory of work, and here ordain you as the Builder of my House.  Unto you I give the word of the Master Builder; unto you I give the tools of the craft; unto you I give the power that has been vested in me.  Be faithful unto these things.  Bring them back when you have finished, and I will give you the name known to God alone.  So mote it be.  The great light died out of the heavens, the streaming fingers of living light vanished in the misty, lonely twilight, and again covered not being with its sable mantle.  Hiram Abiff again stood alone, gazing out into the endless ocean of oblivion   nothing but swirling, seething matter as far as eye could see.  Then he straightened his shoulders and, taking the trestleboard in his hands and clasping to his heart the glowing Word of the Master, walked slowly away and was swallowed up in the mists of primord ial dawn. How may man measure timeless eternity? Ages passed, and the lonely Builder labored with his plan with only love and humility in his heart, his hand molding the darkness which he blessed while his eyes were raised above where the Great Light had shone down from heaven.  In the divine solitude he labored, with no voice to cheer, no spirit to condemn   alone in the boundless all with the great chill of the morning mist upon his brow, but his heart still warm with the light of the Master s Word.  It seemed a ho peless task. No single pair of hands could mold that darkness; no single heart, no matter how true, could be great enough to project pulsing cosmic love into the cold mist of oblivion.  Though the darkness settled ever closer about him and the misty fingers of negation twined round his being, still with divine trust the Builder labored; with divine hope he laid his footings, and from the boundless clay he made the molds to cast his sacred ornaments. Slowl y the building grew and dim forms molded by the Maste r s hand took shape about him. Three huge, soulless creatures had the Master fashioned, great beings which loomed like grim spectres in the semi darkness.  They were three builders he had blessed and now in stately file they passed before him, and Hiram held out his arms to his creation, saying,  Brothers, I have built you for your works.  I have formed you to labor with me in the building of the Master s house.  You are the children of my being; I have labored with yo u, now labor with me for the glory of o ur God.  But the spectres laughed. Turning upon their maker and striking him with his own tools given him by God out of heaven, they left their Grand Master dying in the midst of his labors, broken and crushed by the threefold powers of cosmic night.  As he lay bleeding at the feet of his handiwork the martyred Builder raised his eyes to the seething clouds, and his face was sweet with divine love and cosmic understanding as he prayed unto the Master who had sent him forth:  O Master of Workmen, Great Architect of the universe, my labors are not finished.  Why must they always remain undone? I have not completed the thing for which Thou hast sent me unto being, for my very creations have turned against me and the tools Thou gavest me have destroyed me. The children that I formed in love, in their ignorance have murdered me.  Here, Father, is the Word Thou gavest me now red with my own blood. O Master, I return it to Thee for I have kept it sacred in my heart.  Here are the too ls, the tracing board, and the vessels I have wrought.  Around me stand the ruins of my temple which I must leave.  Unto Thee, O God, the divine Knower of all things, I return them all, realizing that in Thy good time lies the fulfillment of all things.  Thou, O God, knowest our down sitting and our uprising and Thou understandest our thoughts afar off. In Thy name, Father, I have labored and in Thy cause I die, a faithful builder.  The Master fell back, his upturned face sweet in the last repose of death, and the light rays no longer pouring from him.  The gray clouds gathered closer as though to form a winding sheet around the body of their murdered Master. Suddenly the heavens opened again and a shaft of light bathed the form of Hiram in a glory celestial.  Again the Voice spoke from the heavens where the Great King sat upon the clouds of creation:  He is not dead; he is asleep.  Who will awaken him? His labors are not done, and in death he guards the sacred relics more closely than ever, for the Word and the tracing board are his   I have given them to him.  But he must remain asleep until these three who have slain him shall bring him back to life, for ever y wrong must be righted, and the slayers of my house, the destroyers of my temple, must labor in the place of their Builder until they raise their Master from the dead.  The three murderers fell on their knees and raised their hands to heaven as though to ward off the light which had disclosed their crime:  O God, great is our sin, for we have slain our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff! Just is Thy punishment and as we have slain him we now dedicate our lives to his resurrection.  The first was our human weakness, the second our sacred duty.   Be it so,  answered the Voice from Heaven.  The great Light vanished and the clouds of darkness and mist concealed the body of the murdered Master.  It was swallowed up in the swirling darkness which left no mark, no gravestone to mark the place where  the Builder had lain.  O God!  cried the three murderers,  where shall we find our Master now?  A hand reached down again from the Great Unseen and a tiny lamp was handed them, whose oil flame burned silently and clearly in the darkness.   By this light shall ye seek him whom ye have slain.  The three forms surrounded the light and bowed in prayer and thanksgiving for this solitary gleam which was to light the darkness of their way.  From somewhere above in the regions of not being the great Voice spoke, a thundering Voice that filled Chaos with its sound:  He cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he teeth also as a shadow and continueth not; as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not again.  Yet have I compassion upon the children of my creation; I administer unto them in time of trouble and save them with an everlasting salvation.  Seek ye where the broken twig lies and the dead stick molds away, where the clouds float together and the stones rest by the hillside, for all these mark the grave of Hiram who has carried my Will with him to the tomb.  This eternal quest is yours until ye have found your Builder, until the cup giveth up its secret, until the grave givet h up its ghosts. No more shall I speak until ye have found and rais ed my beloved Son, and have listened to the words of my Messenger and with Him as your guide have finished the temple which I shall then inhabit. Amen.  The gray dawn still lay asleep in the arms of darkness.  Out through the great mystery of not being all was silence, unknowable. Through the misty dawn, like strange phantoms of a dream, three figures wandered over the great Unknown carrying in their hands a tiny light, the lamp given to them by their Builder s Father.  Over stick and stone and cloud and star they wandered, eternally in search of a silent grave, stopping again and again to explore the depths of some mystic recess, praying for liberation fr om their endless search; yet bound by their vows to raise the Builder they had slain, whose grave was marked by the broken twig, and whose body was laid away in the white winding sheet of death somewhere over the brow of the eternal hill. TEMPLE BUILDERS You are the temple builders of the future.  With your hands must be raised the domes and spires of a coming civilization.  Upon the foundation you have laid, tomorrow shall build a far more noble edifice.  Builders of the temple of character wherein should dwell an enlightened spirit; truers of the rock of relationship; molders of those vessels created to contain the oil of life: up, and to the task appointed! Never before in the history of men have you had the opportunity that now confronts you. The world waits   waits for the illuminated one who shall come from between the pillars of the portico.  Humility, hoodwinked and bound, seeks entrance to the temple of wisdom.  Fling wide the gate, and let the worthy enter. Fling wide the gate, and let the light that is the life of men shine forth.  Hasten to complete the dwelling of the Lord, that the Spirit of God may come and dwell among His people, sanctified and ordained according to His law. CHAPTER I THE ETERNAL QUEST The average Mason, as well as the modern student of Masonic ideals, little realizes the cosmic obligation he takes upon himself when he begins his search for the sacred truths of Nature as they are concealed in the ancient and modern rituals.  He must not lightly regard his vows, and if he would not bring upon himself years and ages of suffering he must cease to consider Freemasonry solely as a social order only a few centuries old.  He must realize that the ancient mystic teachings as perpetuated in the mo dern rites are sacred, and that powers unseen and unrecognized mold the destiny of those who consciously and of their own free will take upon themselves the obligations of the Fraternity. Freemasonry is not a material thing: it is a science of the soul; it is not a creed or doctrine but a universal expression of the Divine Wisdom.* The coming together of medieval guilds or even the building of Solomon s temple as it is understood today has little, if anything, to do with the true origin of Freemasonry, for Masonry does not deal with personalities.  In its highest sense, it is neither historical nor archaeological, but is a divine symbolic language perpetuating under certain concrete symbols the sacred mysteries of the ancients.  Only those who see in it a cosmic study, a life work, a divine inspiration to better thinking, better feeling, and better living, with the spiritual attainment of enlightenment as the end, and with the daily life of the true Mason as the means, have gained even the slightest insight into the true mysteries of the ancient rites. The age of the Masonic school is not to be calculated by hundreds or even thousands of years, for it never had any origin in the worlds of form.  The world as we see it is merely an experimental laboratory in which man is laboring to build and express greater and more perfect vehicles.  Into this laboratory pour myriads *This term is used as synonymous with a very secret and sacred philosophy that has existed for all time, and has been the inspiration of the great saints and sages of all ages, i. e., the perfect wisdom of God, revealing itself through a secret hierarchy of illumined minds. of rays descending from the cosmic hierarchies.* These mighty globes and orbs which focus their energies upon mankind and mold its destiny do so in an orderly manner, each in its own way and place, and it is the working of these mystic hierarchies in the universe which forms the pattern around which the Masonic school has been built, for the true lodge of the Mason is the universe. Freed of limitations of creed and sect, he stands a master of all faiths, and those who take up the study of Freemasonry witho ut realizing the depth, the beauty, and the spiritual power of its philosophy can never gain anything of permanence from their studies.  The age of the Mystery Schools can be traced by the student back to the dawn of time, ages and aeons ago, when the temple of the Solar Man was in the making.  That was the first Temple of the King, and therein were given and laid down the true mysteries of the ancient lodge, and it was the gods of creation and th e spirits of the dawn who first tiled the Master s lodge. The initiated brother realizes that his so called symbols and rituals are merely blinds  *The groups of celestial intelligences governing the  creative processes in cosmos. fabricated by the wise to perpetuate ideas incomprehensible to the average individual.  He also realizes that few Masons of today know or appreciate the mystic meaning concealed within these rituals. With religious faith we perpetuate the form, worshiping it instead of the life, but those who have not recognized the truth in the crystallized ritual, those who have not liberated the spiritual germ from the shell of empty words, are not Masons, regardless of their physical degrees and outward honors. In the work we are taking up it is not the intention to dwell upon the modern concepts of the Craft but to consider Freemasonry as it really is to those who know, a great cosmic organism whose true brothers and children are tied together not by spoken oaths but by lives so lived that they are capable of seeing through the blank wall and opening the window which is now concealed by the rubbish of materiality.  When this is done and the mysteries of the universe unfold before the aspiring candidate, then in t ruth he discovers what Freemasonry really is.  Its material aspects interest him no longer for he has unmasked the Mystery School which he is capable of recognizing only when he himself has spiritually become a member of it. Those who have examined and studied its ancient lore have no doubt that Freemasonry, like the universe itself, which is the greatest of all schools, deals with the unfolding of a three fold principle; for all the universe is governed by the same three kings who are called the builders of the Masonic temple.  They are not personalities but principles, great intelligent energies and powers which in God, man, and the universe have charge of the molding of cosmic substance into the habitation of the living king , the temple built through the ages first of unconscious and then conscious effort on the part of every individual who is expressing in his daily life the creative principles of these three kings.       The true brodaer of the ancient Craft realized that the completion of the temple he was building to the King of the Universe was a duty or rather a privilege which he owed to his God, to his brother, and to himself.  He knew that certain steps must be taken and that his temple must be built according to the plan.  Today it seems that the plan is lost, however, for in the majority of cases Freemasonry is no longer an operative art but is merely a speculative idea until each brother, reading the mystery of hi s symbols and pondering over the beautiful allegories unfolded in his ritual, realizes that he himself contains the keys and the plans so long lost to his Craft and that if he would ever learn Freemasonry he must unlock its doors with the key wrought from the base metals of his own being. True Freemasonry is esoteric; it is not a thing of this world.  All that we have here is a link, a doorway, through which the student may pass into the unknown.  Freemasonry has nothing to do with things of form save that it realizes form is molded by and manifests the life it contains.  Consequently the student is seeking so to mold his life that the form will glorify the God whose temple he is slowly building as he awakens one by one the workmen within himself and directs them to carry out the plan that h as been given him out of heaven. So far as it is possible to discover, ancient Freemasonry and the beautiful cosmic allegories that it teaches, perpetuated through hundreds of lodges and ancient mysteries, forms the oldest of the Mystery Schools;* and its preser  * This is a term used by the ancients to designate the esoteric side of their religious ceremonials.  The candidate passing through these mysteries was initiated into the mysteries of Nature and the arcane side of natural law. vation through the ages has not depended upon itself as an exoteric body of partly evolved individuals but upon a concealed brotherhood, the exoteric side of Freemasonry. All the great mystery, Schools have hierarchies upon the spiritual planes of Nature which are expressing themselves in this world through creeds and organizations.  The true student seeks to lift himself from the exoteric body upward spiritually until he joins the esoteric group which, without a lodge on the physical plane of Nature, is fa r greater than all the lodges of which it is the central fire.  The spiritual instructors of humanity are forced to labor in the concrete world with things comprehensible to the concrete mind, and there man begins to comprehend the meaning of the allegories and symbols which surround his exoteric work as soon as he prepares himself to receive them.  The true Mason realizes that the work of the Mystery Schools in the world is of an inclusive rathe r than an exclusive nature, and that the only lodge which is b road enough to express his ideals is one whose dome is the heavens, whose pillars are the corners of creation, whose checker board floor is composed of the crossing currents of human emotion and whose altar is the human heart.  Creeds cannot bind the true seeker for truth. Realizing the unity of all truth, the Mason also realizes that the hierarchies laboring with him have given him in his varying degrees the mystic spiritual rituals of all the Mystery S chools in the world, and if he would fill his place i n the plan he must not enter this sacred study for what he can get out of it but that he may learn how to serve. In Freemasonry is concealed the mystery of creation, the answer to the problem of existence, and the path the student must tread in order to join those who are really the living powers behind the thrones of modern national and international affairs.  The true student realizes most of all that the taking of degrees does not make a man a Mason.  A Mason is not appointed; he is evolved and he must realize that the position he holds in the exoteric lodge means nothing compared to his position in the spiritual l odge of life. He must forever discard the idea that he can be told or instructed in the sacred Mysteries or that his being a member of an organization improves him in any way.  He must realize that his duty is to build and evolve the sacred teachings in his own being: that nothing but his own purified being can unlock the door to the sealed libraries of human consciousness, and that his Masonic rites must eternally be speculative until he makes them opera tive by living the life of the mystic Mason.  His ka rmic responsibilities increase with his opportunities.  Those who are surrounded with knowledge and opportunity for self improvement and make nothing of these opportunities are the lazy workmen who will be spiritually, if not physically, cast out of the temple of the king. The Masonic order is not a mere social organization, but is composed of all those who have banded themselves together to learn and apply the principles of mysticism and the occult rites.  They are  or should be  philosophers, sages and sober minded individuals who have dedicated thernselves upon the Masonic altar and vowed by all they hold dear that the world shall be better, wiser, and happier because they have lived.  Those who enter these mystic rites and pass between the pillars seeking either prestige or commercial advantage are blasphemers, and while in this world we may count them as successful, they are the cosmic failures who have barred themselves out from the true rite whose keynote is unselfishness and whose workers have renounced the things of earth. In ancient times many years of preparation were required before the neophyte was permitted to enter the temple of the Mysteries.  In this way the shallow, the curious, the faint of heart, and those unable to withstand the temptations of life were automatically eliminated by their inability to meet the requirements for admission.  The successful candidate wbo did pass between the pillars entered the temple, keenly realizing his sublime opportunity, his divine obligation, and the mystic privilege which he had earned for himself through years of special preparation. Only those are truly Masons who enter their temple in reverence, who seek not the ephemeral things of life but the treasures which are eternal, whose sole desire is to know the true mystery of the Craft that they may join as honest workmen those who have gone before as builders of the Universal Temple.  The Masonic ritual is not a ceremony, but a life to be lived. Those alone are truly Masons who, dedicating their lives and their fortunes upo n the a ltar of the living flame, undertake the construction of the one universal building of which they are the workmen and their God the living Architect.  When we have Masons like this the Craft will again be operative, the flaming triangle will shine forth with greater lustre, the dead builder will rise from his tomb, and the Lost Word so long concealed from the profane will blaze forth again with the power that makes all things new. In the pages that follow have been set down a number of thoughts for the study and consideration of temple builders, craftsmen and artisans alike.  They are the keys which, if only read, will leave the student still in ignorance but, if lived, will change the speculative Masonry of today into the operative Masonry of tomorrow, when each builder, realizing his own place, will see things which he never saw before, not because they were not there but because he was blind.  And there are none so blind as those who will not see. THOUGHTLESSNESS The noblest tool of the Mason is his mind, but its value is measured by the use made of it. Thoughtful in all things, the aspiring candidate to divine wisdom attains reality in sincere desire, in meditation, and in silence.  Let the keynote of the Craft, and of the Ritual, be written in blazing letters: THINK OF ME.  What is the meaning of this mystic maze of symbols, rites and rituals? THINK! What does life mean, with the criss crossings of human relationship, the endless pageantry of qualities masqueradin g in a carnival of fools? THINK! What is the plan behind it all, and who the planner? Where dwells the Great Architect, and what is the tracing board upon which he designs? THINK! What is the human soul, and why the endless yearning to ends unknown, along pathways where each must wander unaccompanied? Why mind, why soul, why spirit, and in truth, why anything? THINK! Is there an answer? If so, where will the truth be found? Think, Brothers o f the Craft, think deeply; for if truth exists, you have it, and if truth be within the reach of living creature, what other goal is worth the struggle?  CHAPTERII THE CANDIDATE There comes a time in the growth of every living individual thing when it realizes with dawning consciousness that it is a prisoner. While apparently free to move and have its being, the struggling life cognizes through ever greater vehicles its own limitations. It is at this point that man cries out with greater insistence to be liberated from the binding ties which, though invisible to mortal eyes, still chain him with bonds far more terrible than those of any physical prison. Many have read the story of the prisoner of Chillon who paced back and forth in the narrow confines of his prison cell, while the blue waters rolled ceaselessly above his head and the only sound that broke the stillness of his eternal night was the constant swishing and lapping of the waves.  We pity the prisoner in his physical tomb and we are sad at heart, for we know how life loves liberty. But there is one prisoner whose plight is far worse than those of earth. He has not even the narrow confines of a prison cell around Him; He cannot pace ceaselessly to and fro and wear ruts in the cobblestones of His dungeon floor.  That eternal Prisoner is Life incarnate within the dark stone walls of matter, with not a single ray to brighten the blackness of His fate.  He fights eternally, praying in the dark confines of gloomy walls for light and opportunity.  This is the eternal Prisoner who, through the ceaseless ages of cosmic unfoldment, through forms unnumbered an d species now unknown, strives eternally to libe rate Himself and gain self conscious expression, the birthright of every created thing.  He awaits the day when, standing upon the rocks that now form His shapeless tomb, He may raise His arms to heaven, bathed in the sunlight of spiritual freedom, free to join the sparkling atoms and dancing light beings released from the bonds of prison wall and tomb. Around Life   that wondrous germ in the heart of every living thing, that sacred Prisoner in His gloomy cell, that Master Builder laid away in the grave of matter   has been built the wondrous legend of the Holy Sepulchre.  Under allegories unnumbered, the mystic philosophers of the ages, have perpetuated this wonderful story, and among the Craft Masons it forms the mystic ritual of Hiram, the Master Builder, murdered in his temple by the very builders who should have served him as he labored to perfect the dwelling place of his God. Matter is the tomb.  It is the dead wall of substance not yet awakened into the pulsating energies of Spirit.  It exists in many degrees and forms, not only in the chemical elements which form the solids of our universe but in finer and more subtle substances. These, though expressing through emotion and thought, are still beings of the world of form.  These substances form the great cross of matter which opposes the growth of all things and by opposition makes all growth possible.  It is the great cross o f hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon upon which even the life germ in protoplasm is crucified and suspended in agony.  These substances are incapable of giving it adequate expression.  The Spirit within cries out for freedom: freedom to be, to express, to manifest its true place in the Great Plan of cosmic unfoldment. It is this great yearning within the heart of man which sends him slowly onward toward the gate of the Temple; it is this inner urge for greater understanding and greater light which brought into being through the law of necessity the great cosmic Masonic Lodge dedicated to those seeking union with the Powers of Light that their prison walls might be removed.  This shell cannot be discarded: it must be raised into union with the Life; each dead, crystallized atom in the human body tnust be set vibrating and spinning to a higher rate of consciousness.  Through purification, through knowledge, and through service to his fellow man the candidate sequentially unfolds these mystic properties, building better and more perfect bodies through which his higher life secures even greater manifestation.  The expression of man through constructive thought, emotion, and action liberates the higher nature from bodies which in their crystallized states are incapa ble of giving him his natural opportunities.   In Freemasonry this crystallized substance of matter is called the grave and represents the Holy Sepulchre.  This is the grave within which the lost Builder lies and with Him are the plans of the Temple and the Master s Word, and it is this builder, our Grand Master, whom we must seek and raise from the dead.  This noble Son of Light cries out to us in every expression of matter.  Every stick and stone marks His resting place, and the sprig of acacia promises that through the long winter of spiritual darkne ss when the sun does not shine for man, this Light still awaits the day of liberation when each one of us shall raise Him by the grip of the Grand Master, the true grip of a Master Mason.  We cannot hear this Voice that calls eternally, but we feel its inner urge.  A great unknown something pulls at our heartstrings.  As the ages roll by, the deep desire to be greater, to live better, and to think God s thoughts, builds within ourselves the qualifica tions of a candidate who, when asked why he takes the path , would truly answer if he knew mentally the things he feels:  I hear a voice that cries out to me from flora and fauna, from the stones, from the clouds, from the very heaven itself.  Each fiery atom spinning and twisting in Cosmos cries out to me with the voice of my Master. I can hear Hiram Abiff, my Grand Master, crying out in his agony, the agony of life hidden within the darkness of its prison walls, seeking for the expression which I have denied it, lab oring, to bring closer the day of its liberation , and I have learned to know that I am responsible for those walls.  My daily actions are the things which as ruffians and traitors are murdering my God.  There are many legends of the Holy Sepulchre which for so many centuries had been in the hands of the infidel and which the Christian worlds sought to retake in the days of the Crusades.  Few Masons realize that this Holy Sepulchre, or tomb, is in reality negation and crystallization   matter that has sealed within itself the Spirit of Life which must remain in darkness until the growth of each individual being gives it walls of glowing gold and changes its stones into windows.  As we develop better and bet ter vehicles of expression, these walls slowly expand until at last Spirit rises triumphant from its tomb and, blessing the very walls that confined it, raises them to union with itself. We may first consider the murderers of Hiram.  These three ruffians, who, when the Builder seeks to leave his temple, strike him with the tools of his own Craft until finally they slay him and bring the temple down in destruction upon their own heads, symbolize the three expressions of our own lower natures which are in truth the murderers of the good within ourselves.  These three may be called thought, desire, and action.  When purified and transmuted they are three glorious avenues through which may mani fest the great life power of the three kings, the glowing builders of the Cosmic Lodge manifesting in this world as spiritual thought, constructive emotion, and useful daily labor in the various places and positions where we find ourselves while carrying on the Master s work.  These three form the Flaming Triangle which glorifies every living Mason, but when crystallized and perverted they form a triangular prison through which the light cann ot shine and the Life is forced to languish in the dim darkness of despair, until man himself through his higher understanding liberates the energies and powers which are indeed the builders and glorifiers of his Father s House. Now let us consider how these three fiery kings of the dawn became, through perversion of their manifestation by man, the ruffians who murdered Hiram   the energizing powers of cosmos which course through the blood of every living being, seeking to beautify and perfect the temple they would build according to the plan laid down on the tracing board by the Master Architect of the universe. First in the mind is one of the three kings, or rather we shall say a channel through which he manifests; for King Solo mon is the power of mind which, perverted, becomes a destroyer who tears down with the very powers which nourish and build.  The right application of thought, when seeking the answer to the cosmic problem of destiny, liberates man s spirit which soars above the concrete through that wonderful power of mind, with its dreams and its ideals. When man s thoughts rise upon the wings of aspiration, when he pushes back the darkness with the strength of reason and logic, then indeed the builder is liberated from his dungeon and the light pours in, bathing him with life and power.  This light enables us to seek more clearly the mystery of creation and to find with greater certainty our place in the Great Plan, for as man unfolds his bodies he gains talents with which he can explore the mysteries of Nature and search for the hidden workings of the Div ine. Through these powers the Builder is liberated and his consciousness goes forth conquering and to conquer.  These higher ideals, these spiritual concepts, these altruistic, philanthropic, educative applications of thought power glorify the Builder; for they give the power of expression and those who can express themselves are free. When man can mold his thoughts, his emotions, and his actions into faithful expressions of his highest ideals then li berty is his, for ignorance is the darkness of Chaos and knowledge is the light of Cosmos. In spite of the fact that many of us live apparently to gratify the desires of the body and as servants of the lower nature, still there is within each of us a power which may remain latent for a great length of time.  This power lives eternities perhaps, and yet at some time during our growth there comes a great yearning for freedom, when, having discovered that the pleasures of sense gratification are eternally elusive and unsatisfying, we make an examination of ourselves and begin to realize that there a re greater reasons for our being.  It is sometimes reason, sometimes suffering, sometimes a great desire to be helpful, that brings out the first latent powers which show that one long wandering in the darkness is about to take the path that leads to Light.  Having lived life in all its experiences, he has learned to realize that all the manifestations of being, all the various experiences through which he passes, are steps leading in one direction; that, consciously or unconsciously, all souls are being le d to the portico of the temple where for the first time they see and realize the glory of Divinity.  It is then that they understand the age old allegory of the martyred Builder and feel his power within themselves crying out from the prison of materiality.  Nothing else seems worth while; and, regardless of cost, suffering, or the taunts of the world, the candidate slowly ascends the steps that lead to the temple eternal.  The reason that governs Cosmos he does not know, the laws which mold his being he do es not realize, but he does know that somewhere behind the veil of human ignorance there is an eternal light toward which step by step he must labor. With his eyes fixed on the heavens above and his hands clasped in prayer he passes slowly as a candidate up the steps.  In fear and trembling, yet with a divine realization of good, he raps on the door and awaits in silence the answer from within. CHAPTER III THE ENTERED APPRENTICE There are three grand steps in the unfoldment of the human soul before it completes the dwelling place of the spirit.  These have been caged respectively youth, manhood, and old age; or, as the Mason would say, the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Builder.  All life passes through these three grand stages of human consciousness.  They can be listed as the man on the outside looking in, the man going in, and the man inside.  The path of human life is governed as all things are by the laws of analogy, and as at birth we start our pilgrimmage through youth, manhood, and old age, so the spiritual consciousness of man in his cosmic path of unfoldment passes from unconsciousness to perfect consciousness in the Grand Lodge of the universe.  Before the initiation of the Entered Apprentice degree can be properly understood and appreciated, certain requirements must be considered, not merely those of the physical world but also those of the spiritual world. The Mason must realize that his true initiation is a spiritual and not a physical ritual, and that his initiation into the living temple of the spiritual hierarchy regulating Freemasonry may not occur until years after he has taken the physical degree, or spiritually he may be a Grand Master before he comes into the world.  There are probably few instances in the history of Freemasonry where the spiritual ordination of the aspiring seeker took place at the same time as the physical initiation, because the t rue initiation depends upon the cultivation of certain soul qualities   an individual and personal matter which is left entirely to the volition of the mystic Mason and which he must carry out in silence and alone. The court of the tabernacle of the ancient Jews was divided into three parts: the outer court, the holy place, and the most Holy of Holies.  These three divisions represent the three grand divisions of human consciousness.  The degree of Entered Apprentice is acquired when the student signifies his intention to take the rough ashlar which he cuts from the quarry and prepares for the truing of the Fellow Craft. In other words, the first degree is really one of preparation; it is a material step dealing with material things, for all spiritual life must be raised upon a material foundation. Seven is the number of the Entered Apprentice as it relates to the seven liberal arts and sciences, and these are the powers with which the Entered Apprentice must labor before he is worthy to go onward into the more elevated and advanced degrees.  They are much mistaken who believe that they can reach the spiritual planes of Nature without first passing through and molding matter into the expression of spiritual power; for the first stage in the growth of a Master Mason is mastery of the concrete condition s of life and the developments of sense centers which will later become channels for the expression of spiritual truths. All growth is a gradual procedure carried on in an orderly, masterly way, as exemplified by the opening and closing of a lodge. The universe is divided into planes and these planes are divided from each other by the rates of vibration which pass through them. As the spiritual consciousness progresses through the chain, the lower lose connection with it when it has raised itself above their level, until finally only the Grand Masters are capable of remaining in session, and unknown even to the Master Mason it finally passes back again to the spiritual hierarchy from which it came. Action is the keynote of the Entered Apprentice lodge. All growth is the result of exercise and the intensifying of vibratory rates. It is through exercise that the muscles of the human body are strengthened; it is through the seven liberal arts and sciences that the human mind receives certain impulses which, in turn, stimulate internal centers of consciousness.  These centers of consciousness, through still greater development, will later give fuller expression to these inner powers; but the Entered Appr entice has for his first duty the awakening of these powers, and, like the youth of whom he is a symbol, his ideals and labors must be tied closely to concrete things.  For him both points of the compasses are under the square; for him the reasons which manifest through the heart and mind   the two polarities of expression are darkened and concealed beneath the square which measures the block of bodies.  He knows not the reason why; his work is t o follow the directions of those whose knowledge is greater th an his own; but as the result of the application of energies, through action and reaction he slowly builds and evolves the powers of discrimination and the strength of character which mark the Fellow Craft degree. It is obvious that the rough ashlar symbolizes the body.  It also represents cosmic root substance which is taken out of the quarry of the universe by the first expressions of intelligence and molded by them into ever finer and more perfect lines until finally it becomes the perfect stone for the Builder s temple. How can emotion manifest save through form? How can mind manifest until the intricately evolved brain cells of matter have raised their organic quality to form the ground work upon which other things may be based? All students of human mature realize that every expression of man depends upon organic quality; that in every living thing this differs; and that the fineness of this matter is the certain indication of growth   mental, physical or spiritual. True to the doctrines of his Craft, the Entered Apprentice must beautify his temple. He must build within himself by his actions, by the power of his hand and the tools of his Craft, certain qualities which make possible his initiation into the higher degrees of the spiritual lodge. We know that the cube block is symbolic of the tomb.  It is also well known that the Entered Apprentice is incapable of rolling away the stone or of transmuting it into a greater or higher thing; but it is his privilege to purify and glorify that stone and begin the great work of preparing it for the temple of his King. Few realize that since the universe is made up of individuals in various stages of development, responsibility is consequently individual, and everything which man wishes to gain he must himself build and maintain.  If he is to use his finer bodies for the purpose for which they were intended, he must treat them well, that they may be good and faithful servants in the great work he is preparing for. The quarries represent the limitless powers of natural resources. They are symbolic of the practically endless field of human opportunity; they symbolize the cosmic substances from which man must gather the stones for his temple.  At this stage in his growth, the Entered Apprentice is privileged to gather the stones which he wishes to true during his progress through the lodge, for at this point he symbolizes the youth who is choosing his life work.  He represents the human ego who in the dawn of time gath ered many blocks and cubes and broken stones from the Great Quarry. These rough and broken stones that as yet will not fit into anything are the partially evolved powers and senses with which he labors.  In the first state he must gather these materials, and those who have not gathered them can never true them.  During the involuntary period of human consciousness, the Entered Apprentice in the Great Lodge was man, who labored with these rough blocks, seeking the tools and the power with which to true them .  As he evolves down through the ages, he gains the tools and cosmically passes on to the degree of Fellow Craft where he trues his ashlar in harmony with the plans upon the Master s tracing board.  This rough, uncut ashlar has three dimensions, representative of the three ruffians who at this stage are destroyers of the fourth dimensional life concealed within the ugly, ill shaped stone. The lost key of the Entered Apprentice is service.  Why, he may not ask; when, he does not know.  His work is to do, to act, to express himself in some way   constructively if possible, but destructively rather than not at all.  Without action, he loses his great work; without tools, which symbolize the body, he cannot act in an organized manner.  Consequently, it is necessary to master the arts and sciences which place in his hands intelligent tools for the expression of energy.  Beauty is the keynote to h is ideal.  With his concrete ideals he must beautify all with which he comes in contact, so that the works of his hand may be acceptable in the eyes of the Great Architect of the Universe. His daily life, in home, business, and society, together with the realization of the fundamental unity of each with all, form the base upon which the aspiring candidate may raise a greater superstructure.  In truth he must live the life, the result of which is the purification of his body, so that the more attenuated forces of the higher degrees may express themselves through the finer sensitivity of the receiving pole within himself.  When he reaches this stage in his growth, he is spiritually worthy to co nsider advancement into a higher degree.  This advancement is not the result of election or ballot, but is an automatic process in which, having sensitized his consciousness by his life, he thereby attunes himself to the next succeeding plane of expression.  All initiation is the result of adjustments of the evolving life to the physical, emotional, and mental planes of consciousness through which it passes. We may now consider the spiritual requirements of one who feels that he would mystically correlate himself with that great spiritual fraternity which, concealed behind the exoteric rite, forms the living power of the Entered Apprentice lodge:  . It is essential that the Entered Apprentice should have studied sufficiently the subject of anatomy to have at least a general idea of the physical body, for the entire degree is based upon the mystery of form.  The human body is the highest manifestation of form which he is capable of analyzing.  Consequently, he must devote himself to the study of his own being and its mysteries and complexities.  . The Entered Apprentice must realize that his body is the living temple of the living God and treat it accordingly; for when he abuses or mistreats it he breaks the sacred obligations which he must assume before he can ever hope to understand the true mysteries of the Craft.  The breaking of his pact with the higher Life evolving within himself unfailingly invokes the retributive agencies of Nature.  . He must study the problem of the maintenance of bodies through food, clothing, breathing, and other necessities, as all of these are important steps in the Entered Apprentice lodge.  Those who eat immoderately, dress improperly, and use only about one third of their lung capacity can never have the physical efficiency necessary for the fullest expression of the higher Life.  . He must grow physically and in the expression of concrete things.  Human relationships must be idealized at this time, and he must seek to unfold all unselfish qualities which are necessary for the harmonious working of the Mason and his fellow men on the physical plane of Nature.  . He must seek to round off all inequalities.  He can best do this by balancing his mental and physical organisms through the application and study of the seven liberal arts and sciences. Until he is relatively master of these principles on the highest plane within his own being, he cannot hope spiritually to attract to himself, through the qualities of his own character, the life giving ray of the Fellow Craft.  When he reaches this point, however, he is spiritually ready to hope for membership in a more advanced degree. The Mason must realize that his innermost motives are the index of his real self, and those who allow social position, financial or business considerations or selfish and materialistic ideals, to lead them into the Masonic Brotherhood have thereby automatically separated themselves from the Craft.  They can never do any harm to Freemasonry by joining because they cannot get in. Ensconced within the lodge, they may feel that they have deceived the Grand Master of the Universe, but when the spiritual lodge me ets to carry on the true work of the Craft, they are disqualified and absent. Watch fobs, lapel badges, and other insignia do not make Masons; neither does the ritual ordain them.  Masons are evolved through the self conscious effort to live up to the highest ideals within themselves; their lives are the sole insignia of their rank, greater by far than any visible, tangible credential. Bearingy this in mind, it is possible for the unselfish, aspiring soul to become spiritually and liberally vouched for by the centers of consciousness as an Entered Apprentice.  It means he has taken the first grand step on the path of personal liberation.  He is now symbolized as the child with the smiling face, for with the simplicity of a child he places himself under the protection of his great spiritual Father, willing and glad to obey each of His commands.  Having reached this point and having done th e best it was possible for him to do, he is in position to hope that the powers that be, moving in their mysterious manner, may find him worthy to undertake the second great step in spiritual liberation. CHAPTER IV THE FELLOW CRAFT Life manifests not only through action on the physical plane, but through human emotion and sentiment.  This is the type of energy taken up by the student when he starts his labors in the Fellow Craft.  From youth with its smiling face, he passes on to the greater responsibilities of manhood. On the second step of the temple stands a soldier dressed in shining armor, but his sword is sheathed and a book is in his hand. He is symbolic of strength, the energy of Mars, and the wonderful step in spiritual unfoldment which we know as Fellow Craft. Through each one of us course the fiery rays of human emotion, a great seething cauldron of power behind each expression of human energy.  Like spirited horses chafing at the bit, like hounds eager for the chase, the emotional powers cannot be held in che ck, but break the walls of restraint and pour forth as fiery expressions of dynamic energy. This great principle of emotion we know as the second murderer of Hiram.  Through the perversion of human emotions there comes into the world untold sorrow, which through reaction, manifests in the mental and physical bodies. It is strange how divine powers may become perverted until each expression and urge becomes a ruffian and a murderer.  The divine compassion of the gods manifests in this world of form very differently than in the realms of light.  Divine compassion is emergized by the same influxes as mortal passions and the lusts of earth.  The spiritual light rays of Cosmos   the Fire Princes of the Dawn   which seethe and surge through the unregenerate man, are the impulses which he perverts to murder and hate.  The cea seless power of Chaos, the seething pinwheel spiralds of perpetual motion, whose majestic cadences are the music of the spheres, are energized by the same great power that man uses to destroy the highest and best.  The same mystic power that keeps the planets in their orbits around the solar body, the same energy that keeps each electron spinning and whirling, the same energy that is building the temple of God, is now a merciless slave driver which , unmastered and uncurbed, strikes the Compassionate One and sends him reeling backward into the darkness of his prison.  Man does not listen to that little voice which speaks to him in ever loving, ever sorrowful tones.  This voice speaks of the peace accompanying the constructive application of energy which he must chain if he would master the powers of creation.  How long will it take King Hiram of Tyre, the warrior on the second step, symbolic of the Fellow Craft of the Cosmic Lodge, to teach mankind the lessons of sel f mastery? The teacher can do it only as he daily depicts the miseries which are the resilt of uncurbed appetites.  The strength of man was not given to be used destructively but that he might build a temple worthy to be the dwelling place of the Great Architect of the universe.  God is glorifying himself through the individualized portions of himself, and is slowly teaching these individualized portions to understand and glorify the whole. The day has come when Fellow Craftsmen must know and apply their knowledge.  The lost key to their grade is the mastery of emotion, which places the energy of the universe at their disposal.  Man can only expect to be entrusted with great power by proving his ability to use it constructively and selflessly.  When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft.  The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.  He must follow in the footsteps of his forefather, Tubal Cain, who with the mighty strength of the war god hammered his sword into a plowshare.  Incessant vigilance over thought, action, and desire is indispensable to those who wish to make progress in the unfolding of their own being, and the Fellow Craft s degree is the degree of transmutation.  The hand that slays must lift the fallen, while the lips given to cursing must be taught to pray.  The heart that hates must learn the mystery of compassion, as the result of a deeper and more perfect understanding of man s relation to his brother.  The firm, kind hand of spirit must curb the flaming powers of emotion with an iron grip.  In the realization and application of these principles lies the key of the Fellow Craft. In this degree, the two points of the compass  one higher than the other , symbolize the heart and mind, and with the expression of the higher emotions the heart point of the compass is liberated from the square, which is an instrument used to measure the block of matter and therefore symbolizes form. A large percentage of the people of the world at the present time are passing through, spiritually, the degree of the Fellow Craft, with its five senses.  The sense perceptions come under the control of the emotional energies, therefore the development of the senses is necessary to the constructive expression of the Fellow Craft power.  Man must realize that all the powers which his many years of need have earned for him have come in order that through them he may liberate more fully the prisoner within his own being.  As the Fellow Craft degree is the middle of the three, the spiritual duty of each member is to reach the point of poise or balance, which is always secured between extremes.  The mastery of expression is also to be found in this degree.  The keywords of the Fellow Craft may be briefly defined as compassion, poise, and transmutation. In the Fellow Craft degree is concealed the dynamo of human life. The Fellow Craft is the worker with elemental fire, which it is his duty to transmute into spiritual light.  The heart is the center of his activity and it is while in this degree that the human side of the nature with its constructive emotions should be brought out and emphasized.  But all of these expressions of the human heart must become transmuted into the emotionless compassion of the gods, who despite the suffering of the moment, gaze down upon mankind and see that it is good. When the candidate feels that he has reached a point where he is able to manifest every energizing current and fire flame in a constructive, balanced manner and has spiritually lifted the heart sentiments of the mystic out of the cube of matter, he may then expect that the degree of Master Mason is not far off, and so may look forward eagerly to the time of his spiritual ordination into the higher degree.  He should now study himself and realize that he cannot receive promotion into the spiritual lodge unti l his heart is attuned to a superior, spiritual influx from the causal planes of consciousness. The following requirements are necessary before the student can spiritually say that he is a member of the ancient and accepted rite of the Fellow Craft:  . The mastery of emotional outbreaks of all kinds, poise under trying conditions, kindness in the face of unkindness, and simplicity with its accompanying power.  These points show that the seeker is worthy of being taught by a Fellow Craftsman.  . The mastery of the animal energies, the curbing of passion and desire, and the control of the lower nature mark the faithful attempts on the part of the student to be worthy of the Fellow Craft.  . The understanding and mastery of the creative forces, the consecration of them to the unfolding of the spiritual nature, and a proper understanding of their physical application, are necessary steps at this stage of the student s growth.  .  The transmutation of personal affection into impersonal compassion shows that the Fellow Craftsman truly understands his duties and is living in a manner worthy of his order. Personalities cannot bind the true second degree member, for having raised one point of the compasses he now realizes that all personal manifestations are governed by impersonal principles.  . At this point the candidate consecrates the five senses to the study of human problems with the unfolding of sense centers as the motive; for he realizes that the five senses are keys, the proper application of which will give him material for spiritual transmutation if he will apply to them the common divisor of analogy. The Entered Apprentice may be termed a materialistic degree.  The Fellow Craft is religious and mystical, while the Master Mason is occult or philosophical.  Each of these is a degree in the unfoldment of a connected life and intelligence, revealing in ever fuller expression the gradual liberation of the Master from the trianglar cell of threefold negation which marks the early stage of individualization. CHAPTER V THE MASTER MASON On the upper steps of spiritual unfoldment stands the Master Mason, who spiritually represents the graduate from the school of esoteric learning. In the ancient symbols he is represented as an old man leaning upon a staff, his long white beard upon his chest, and his deep, piercing eyes sheltered by the brows of a philosopher.  He is in truth old, not in years, but in wisdom and understanding, which are the only true measurement of age.  Through years and lives of labor he has found the staff of life and tr uth upon which he leans.  He no longer depends upon the words of others but upon the still voice that speaks from the heart of his own being.  There is no more glorious position that a man may hold than that of a Master Builder, who has risen by labor through the degrees of human consciousness.  Time is the differentiation of eternity devised by man to measure the passage of human events.  On the spiritual planes of Nature it is the space or distance between the s tages of spiritual growth and hence is not m easurable by material means. Many a child comes into this world a Grand Master of the Masonic School, while many a revered and honored brother passes silently to rest without having gained admittance to its gate.  The Master Mason is one whose life is full, pressed down and brimming over with the experience he has gained in his slow pilgrimage up the winding stairs. The Master Mason embodies the power of the human mind, that connecting link which binds heaven and earth together in an endless chain.  His spiritual light is greater because he has evolved a higher vehicle for its expression.  Above even constructive action and emotion soars the power of thought which swiftly flies on wings to the source of Light.  The mind is the highest form of his human expression and he passes into the great darkness of the inner room illuminated only by the fruits of reason.  The glor ious privileges of a Master Mason are in keeping with his greater knowledge and wisdom.  From the student he has blossomed forth as the teacher; from the kingdom of those who follow he has joined that little group who must always lead the way.  For him the Heavens have opened and the Great Light has bathed him in its radiance.  The Prodigal Son, so long a wanderer in the regions of darkness, has returned again to his Father s house.  The voice speaks from the Heavens, its power thrilling the Master until hi s own being seems filled with its divinity, saying,  This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  The ancients taught that the sun was not a source of light, life, or power, but a medium through which life and light were reflected into physical substance.  The Master Mason is in truth a sun, a great reflector of light, who radiates through his organism, purified by ages of preparation, the glorious power which is the light of the Lodge.  He, in truth, has become the spokesman of the Most High.  He st ands between the glowing fire light and the world.  Through him passes Hydra, the great snake, and from its month there pours to man the light of God.  His symbol is the rising sun, for in him the globe of day has indeed risen in all its splendor from the darkness of the night, illuminating the immortal East with the first promise of approaching day. With a sigh the Master lays aside his tools.  For him the temple is nearing completion, the last stones are being placed, and he slakes his lime with a vague regret as he sees dome and minaret rise through the power of his handiwork.  The true Master does not long for rest, and as he sees the days of his labor close, a sadness weighs upon his heart.  Slowly the brothers of his Craft leave him, each going his respective way; and, climbing step by step, the Master stands alone on the pinnacle of the temple. One stone must yet be placed, but this he cannot find.  Somewhere it lies concealed.  In prayer he kneels, asking the powers that be to aid him in his search.  The light of the sun shines upon him and bathes him in a splendor celestial.  Suddenly a voice speaks from the Heavens, saying,  The temple is finished and in my faithful Master is found the missing stone.  Both points of the compasses are now lifted from under the square. The divine is liberated from its cube; heart and mind alike are liberated from the symbol of mortality, and as emotion and thought they unite for the glorification of the greatest and the highest. Then the Sun and Moon are united and the Hermetic Degree is consummated. The Master Mason is afforded opportunities far beyond the reach of ordinary man, but he must not fail to realize that with every opportunity comes a cosmic responsibility.  It is worse by far to know and not to do than never to have known at all.  He realizes that the choice of avoiding responsibility is no longer his and that for him all problems must be met and solved.  The only joy in the heart of the Master is the joy of seeing the fruits of his handiwork.  It can be truly said of the Master that throug h suffering he has learned to be glad, through weeping he has learned to smile, and through dying he has learned to live.  The purification and probationship of his previous degrees have so spiritualized his being that he is in truth a glorious example of God s Plan for His children.  The greatest sermon he can preach, the greatest lesson he can teach, is that of standing forth a living proof of the Eternal Plan.  The Master Mason is not ordained: h e is the natural product of cause and effect, and none but those who live the cause can produce the effect.  The Master Mason, if he be truly a Master, is in communication with the unseen powers that move the destinies of life.  As the Eldest Brother of the lodge, he is the spokesman for the spiritual hierarchies of his Craft.  He no longer follows the direction of others, but on his own tracing board he lays out the plans which his brothers are to follow.  He realizes this, and so lives that every line and plan which he gives out is inspired by the divine with in h imself.  His glorious opportunity to be a factor in the growth of others comes before all else.  At the seat of mercy he kneels, a faithful servant of the Highest within himself and worthy to be given control over the lives of others by having first controlled himself. Much is said concerning the loss of the Master s Word and how the seekers go out to find it but bring back only substitutes.  The true Master knows that those who go out can never find the secret trust.  He alone can find it who goes within.  The true Master Builder has never lost the Word but has cherished it in the spiritual locket of his own being.  From those who have the eyes to see, nothing is concealed; to those who have the right to know, all things are open books.  The true Word of the three Grand Masters has never been concealed from those who have the right to know it nor has it ever been revealed to those who have not prepared a worthy shrine to contain it.  The Master knows, for he is a Temple Builder.  Within the setting of his own bodies, the Philosopher s Stone is placed; for in truth it is the heart of the Phoenix, that strange bird which rises with renewed youth from the ashes of its burned body.  When the Master s heart is as pure and white as the diamond that he wears, he will then become a living stone the crown jewel in the diadem of his Craft. The Word is found when the Master himself is ordained by the living hand of God, cleansed by living water, baptized by living fire, a Priest King after the Order of Melchizedek, who is above the law. The geat work of the Master Mason can be called the art of balance. To him is given the work of balancing the triangle that it may blaze forth with the glory of the Divine Degree.  The triple energies of thought, desire, and action must be united in a harmonious blending of expression.  He holds in his hands the triple keys; he wears the triple crown of the ancient Magus, for he is in truth the King of heaven, earth, and hell.  Salt, sulphur, and mercury are the elements of his work and with the philosophi cal mercury he seeks to blend all powers to the glorifying of one end. Behind the degree of Master Mason, there is another not known to earth.  Far above him stretch other steps concealed by the blue veil which divides the seen from the unseen.  The true Brother knows this, therefore he works with an end in view far above the concept of mortal mind.  He seeks to be worthy to pass behind that veil and join that band who, unhonored and unsung, carry the responsibilities of human growth.  His eyes are fixed forever on the Seven Stars which shine down from somewhere above the uppe r rung of the ladder.  With hope, faith, and charity he climbs the steps, and whispering the Master s Word to the Keeper of the Gates, passes on behind the veil.  It is then, and then only, that a true Mason is born.  Only behind this veil does the mystic student come into his own.  The things which we see around us are but forms promises of a thing unnamed, symbols of a truth unknown.  It is in the spiritual temple built without the voice of wo rkmen or the sound of hammer that the true initiation is given, and there, robed in the simple lambskin of a purified body, the student becomes a Master Mason, chosen out of the world to be an active worker in the name of the Great Architect.  It is there alone, unseen by mortal eyes, that the Greater Degrees are given and there the soul radiating the light of Spirit becomes a living; star in the blue canopy of the Masonic lodge. TRANSMUTATION Masonry is eternal truth, personified, idealized, and yet made simple.  Eternal truth alone can serve it.  Virtue is its priest, patience its warden, illumination its master. The world cannot know this, however, save when Masons in their daily life prove that it is so. Its truth is divine, and is not to be desecrated or defamed by the thoughtlessness of its keepers. Its temple is a holy place, to be entered in reverence. Material thoughts and material dissensions must be left without its gate.  They may not enter. Only the pure of heart, regenerated and transmuted, may pass the sanctity of its veil.  The schemer has no place in its ranks, nor the materialist in its shrine; for Masons walk on hallowed ground, sanctified by the veneration of ages.  Let the tongue be stilled, let the heart be stilled, let the mind be stilled.  In reverence and in the silence, stillness shall speak: the voice of stillness is the voice of the Creator.  Show your light and yo ur power to men, but before God what have you to offe r, save in humility? Your robes, your tinsel, and your jewels mean naught to Him, until your own body and soul, gleaming with the radiance of perfection, become the living ornaments of your Lodge. THE PRESENCE OF THE MASTER The Mason believes in the Great Architect, the living keystone of creation s plan, the Master of all Lodges, without whose spirit there is no work.  Let him never forget that the Master is near. Day and night let him feet the presence of the Supreme or Overshadowing One.  The All Seeing Eye is upon him.  Day and night this great Orb measures his depths, seeing into his innermost soul of souls, judging his life, reading his thoughts, measuring his aspirations, and rewarding his sincerity.  To this All Seein g One he is accountable; to none other must he account.  This Spirit passes with him out of the Lodge and measures the Mason in the world. This Spirit is with him when he buys and sells.  It is with him in his home.  By the light of day and by the darkness of night it judges him. It hears each thoughtless word. It is the silent witness to every transaction of life, the silent Partner of every man. By the jury of his acts, each man is judged. Let e very Mason know that his obligations include not only those w ithin the narrow Lodge, bordered by walls of stone and brick, but those in the Great Lodge, walled only by the dome of heaven.  The Valley of Jehoshaphat waits for him who is false to any creature, as surely as it waited for the breakers of the Cosmic oath. CHAPTER VI THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A TRUE MASON Every true Mason has come into the realization that there is but one Lodge   that is, the Universe   and but one Brotherhood, composed of everything that moves or exists in any of the planes of Nature.  He realizes that the Temple of Solomon is really the Temple of the Solar Man  Sol Om On   the King of the Universe manifesting through his three primordial builders.  He realizes that his vow of brotherhood and fraternity is universal, and that mineral, plant, animal, and man are all included in the true Mas onic Craft. His duty as an elder brother to all the kingdoms of Nature beneath him is well understood by the true Craftsman, who would rather die than fail in this, his great obligation.  He has dedicated his life upon the altar of his God and is willing and glad to serve the lesser through the powers he has gained from the greater. The mystic Mason, in building the eyes that see behind the apparent ritual, recognizes the oneness of life manif esting through the diversity of form. The true disciple of ancient Masonry has given up forever the worship of personalities.  With his greater insight, he realizes that all forms and their position in material affairs are of no importance to him compared to the life which is evolving within. Those who allow appearances or worldly expressions to deter them from their self appointed tasks are failures in Masonry, for Masonry is an abstract science of spiritual unfoldment.  Material prosperity is not the measure of soul growth.  The true Mason r ealizes that behind these diverse forms there is one connected Life Principle, the spark of God in all living things.  It is this Life which he considers when measuring the worth of a brother.  It is to this Life that he appeals for a recognition of spiritual Unity.  He realizes that it is the discovery of this spark of Unity which makes him a conscious member of the Cosmic Lodge.  Most of all, he must learn to understand that this divine spark shines out as brightly from the body of a foe as it does from t he dearest friend.  The true Mason has learned to be divinely impersonal in thought, action, and desire. The true Mason is not creed bound.  He realizes with the divine illumination of his lodge that as Mason his religion must be universal: Christ, Buddha or Mohammed, the name means little, for he recognizes only the light and not the bearer.  He worships at every shrine, bows before every altar, whether in temple, mosque or cathedral, realizing with his truer understanding the oneness of all spiritual truth.  All true Masons know that they only are heathen who, having great ideals, do not live up to them.  Th ey know that all religions are but one story told in divers ways for peoples whose ideals differ but whose great purpose is in harmony with Masonic ideals.  North, east, south and west stretch the diversities of human thought, and while the ideals of man apparently differ, when all is said and the crystallization of form with its false concepts is swept away, one basic truth remains: all existing things are Temple Builders, laboring for a single end.  No true Mason can be narrow, for his Lodge is the divine expression of all broadness.  There is no place for little minds in a great work. The true Mason must develop the powers of observation.  He must seek eternally in all the manifestations of Nature for the things which he has lost because he failed to work for them.  He must become a student of human nature and see in those around him the unfolding and varying expressions of one connected spiritual Intelligence.  The great spiritual ritual of his lodge is enacted before him in every action of his fellow man.  The entire Masonic initiation is an open secret, for anyone can see it played ou t on the city street corners as well as in the untracked wilderness. The Mason has sworn that every day he will extract from life its message for him and build it into the temple of his God.  He seeks to learn the things which will make him of greater service in the Divine Plan, a better instrument in the hands of the Great Architect, who is laboring eternally to unfold life through the medium of living things.  The Mason realizes, moreover, tha t his vows, taken of his own free will and accord, give him th e divine opportunity of being a living tool in the hands of a Master Workman. The true Master Mason enters his lodge with one thought uppermost in his mind:  How can I, as an individual, be of greater use in the Universal Plan? What can I do to be worthy to comprehend the mysteries which are unfolded here? How can I build the eyes to see the things which are concealed from those who lack spiritual understanding?  The true Mason is supremely unselfish in every expression and application of the powers that have been entrusted to him.  No true Brother seeks anything for himself, but uns elfishly labors for the good of all.  No person who assumes a spiritual obligation for what he can get out of it is worthy of applying for the position even of water carrier.  The true Light can come only to those who, asking nothing, gladly give all to it. The true brother of the Craft, while constantly striving to improve himself, mentally, physically, and spiritually through the days of his life, never makes his own desires the goal for his works.  He has a duty and that duty is to fit into the plans of another.  He must be ready at any hour of the day or night to drop his own ideals at the call of the Builder.  The work must be done and he has dedicated his life to the service of those who know the bonds of neither time nor space.  He must be ready at any moment s notice and his life should be turned into preparing himself for that call which may come when he least expects it.  The Master Mason knows that those most useful to the Plan are those who have gained the most from the practical experiences of life.  It is not what goes on within the tiled lodge which is the basis of his greatness, but rather the way in which he meets the problems of daily life.  The true Masonic student is known by his brotherly a ctions and common sense. Every Mason knows that a broken vow brings with it a terrible penalty.  Let him also realize that failure to live mentally, spiritually, and morally up to one s highest ideals constitutes the greatest of all broken oaths.  When a Mason swears that he will devote his life to the building of his Father s house and then defiles his living temple through the perversion of mental power, emotional force, and active energy, he is breaking a vow which imposes not hours but ages of misery.  If he is worthy to be a M ason, he must be great enough to restrain the lower side of his own nature which is daily murdering his Grand Master.  He must realize that a misdirected life is a broken vow and that daily service, purification, and the constructive application of energy is a living invocation which builds within and draws to him the power of the Creator.  His life is the only prayer acceptable in the eyes of the Most High.  An impure life is a broken trust; a destructive action is a living curse; a narrow mind is a strang le cord around the throat of God. All true Masons know that their work is not secret, but they realize that it must remain unknown to all who do not live the true Masonic life.  Yet if the so called secrets of Freemasonry were shouted from the housetops, the Fraternity would be absolutely safe; for certain spiritual qualities are necessary before the real Masonic secrets can be understood by the brethren themselves. Hence it is that the alleged  exposures  of Freemasonry, printed by the thousands and tens of thousands since      down to the present hour, cannot injure the Fraternity.  They reveal merely the outward forms and ceremonies of Freemasonry.  Only those who have been weighed in the balance and found to be true, upright, and square have prepared themselves by their own growth to appreciate the inner meanings of their Craft.  To the rest of their brethren within or without the lodge their sacred rituals must remain, as Shakespeare might have said,  Words, words, words.  Within the Mason s own being is concealed the Power, which, blazi ng forth from his purified being, constitutes the Builder s Word.  His life is the sole password which admits him to the true Masonic Lodge. His spiritual urge is the sprig of acacia which, through the darkness of ignorance, still proves that the spiritual fire is alight.  Within himself he must build those qualities which will make possible his true understanding of the Craft.  He can show the world only forms which mean nothing; the life within is fo rever concealed until the eye of Spirit reveals it. The Master Mason realizes charity to be one of the greatest traits which the Elder Brothers have unfolded, which means not only properly regulated charity of the purse but charity in thought and action.  He realizes that all the workmen are not on the same step, but wherever each may be, he is doing the best he can according to his light.  Each is laboring with the tools that he has, and he, as a Master Mason, does not spend his time in criticizing but in helping them to improve their tools.  Instead of bla ming poor tools, let us always blame ourselves for having them.  The Master Mason does not find fault; he does not criticize nor does he complain, but with malice towards none and charity towards all he seeks to be worthy of his Father s trust.  In silence he labors, with compassion he suffers, and if the builders strike him as he seeks to work with them, his last word will be a prayer for them. The greater the Mason, the more advanced in his Craft, the more fatherly he grows, the walls of his Lodge broade ning out until all living things are sheltered and guarded within the blue folds of his cape.  From laboring with the few he seeks to assist all, realizing with his broader understanding the weaknesses of others but the strength of right. A Mason is not proud of his position.  He is not puffed up by his honor, but with a sinking heart is eternally ashamed of his own place, realizing that it is far below the standard of his Craft. The farther he goes, the more he realizes that he is standing on slippery places and if he allows himself for one moment to lose his simplicity and humility, a fall is inevitable.  A true Mason never feels himself worthy of his Craft.  A student may stand on the top of Fool s Mountain self satisfied in his position , but the true Brother is always noted for his simplicity. A Mason cannot be ordained or elected by ballot.  He is evolved through ages of self purification and spiritual transmutation. There are thousands of Masons who are brethren in name only, for their failure to exemplify the ideals of their Craft makes them unresponsive to the teachings and purpose of Freemasonry.  The Masonic life forms the first key of the Temple and without this key, none of the doors can be opened.  When this fact is better realized and lived, Freemasonry will awake, and speak the Word s o long withheld.  The speculative Craft will then become operative, and the Ancient Wisdom so long concealed will rise from the ruins of its temple as the greatest spiritual truth yet revealed to man. The true Master Mason recognizes the value of seeking for truth wherever he can find it. It makes no difference if it be in the enemy s camp; if it be truth, he will go there gladly to secure it. The Masonic Lodge is universal; therefore all true Masons will seek through the extremities of creation for their Light.  The true brother of the Craft knows and applies one great paradox.  He must search for the high things in lowly places and find the lowly things in high places.  The Mason who feels holier than his fellow man has raised a barrier around himself through which no light can pass, for the one who in truth is the greatest is the servant of all.  Many brethren make a great mistake in building a wall around their secrets, for they succeed only in shutting out their own light.  Their divine opportunity is at hand. The time has come when the world needs the Ancient Wisdom as never before. Let the Mason stand forth and by living the doctrines which he preaches show to his brother man the glory of his work. He holds the keys to truth; let him unlock the door, and with his life and not his words preach the doctrine which he has so long professed. The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man were united in the completion of the Eternal Temple, the Great Work, for which all things came into being and through which all shall glorify their Creator. MASONS, AWAKE! Your creed and your Craft demand the best that is in you.  They demand the sanctifying of your life, the regeneration of your body, the purification of your soul, and the ordination of your spirit. Yours is the glorious opportunity; yours is the divine responsibility.  Accept your task and follow in the footsteps of the Master Masons of the past, who with the flaming spirit of the Craft have illumined the world.  You have a great privilege   the privilege of illumined labor.  You may know the ends to which you work, while others must struggle in darkness. Your labors are not to be confined to the tiled Lodge alone, for a Mason must radiate the qualities of his Craft.  Its light must shine in his home and in his business, glorifying his association with his fellow men. In the Lodge and out of the Lodge, the Mason must represent the highest fruitage of sincere endeavor. EPILOGUE THE PRIEST OF RA What words are there in modern language to describe the great temple of Ammon Ra? It now stands amidst the sands of Egypt a pile of broken ruins, but in the heyday of its glory it rose a forest of plumed pillars holding up roofs of solid sandstone, carved by hands long laid to rest into friezes of lotus blossoms and papyrus and colored lifelike by pigments the secrets of which were lost with the civilization that discovered them.      A checkerboard floor of black and white blocks stretched out until it was lost among the wilderness of pillars.  From the massive walls the impassive faces of gods unnamed looked down upon the silent files of priests who kept alight the altar fires, whose feeble glow alone alighted the massive chambeors throughout the darkness of an Egyptian night.  It was a weird, impressive scene, and the flickering lights sent strange, ghostly forms scurrying among the piles of granite which rose like mighty altars from the darkness below to be lost in the shadows above. Suddenly a figure emerged from the shadows, carrying in his hand a small oil lamp which pierced the darkness like some distant star, bringing into strange relief the figure of him who bore it.  He appeared to be old, for his long beard and braided hair were quite gray, but his large black eyes shone with a fire seldom seen even in youth.  He was robed from head to foot in blue and gold, and around his forehead was coiled a snake of precious metal, set with jewelled eyes that gave out flashes of light.  Neve r had the light of Ra s chamber shone on a grander head or a form more powerful than that of the high priest of the temple.  He was the mouthpiece of the gods and the sacred wisdom of ancient Egypt was impressed in fiery letters upon his soul.  As he crossed the great room   in one hand the sceptre of the priestcraft, in the other the tiny lamp   he was more like a spirit visitor from beyond the environs of death than a physical being, for his jewelled san dals made no sound and the sheen from his robes form ed a halo of light around his stately form. Down through the silent passageways, lined with their massive pillars, passed the phantom figure   down steps lined with kneeling sphinxes and through avenues of crouching lions the priest picked his way until at last he reached a vaulted chamber whose marble floor bore strange designs traced in some language long forgotten. Each angle of the many sided and dimly lighted room was filled by a seated figure carved in stone, so massive that its head and shoulders were lost in shadows no eye could pierce. In the center of this mystic chamber stood a great chest of some black stone carved with serpents and strange winged dragons.  The lid was a solid slab, weighing hundreds of pounds, without handle of any kind and the chest apparently had no means of being opened without the aid of some herculean power. The high priest leaned over and from the lamp he carried lighted the fire upon an altar that stood near, sending the shadows of that weird chamber scurrying into the most distant corners.  As the flame rose, it was reflected from the great stone faces above, which seemed to stare at the black coffer in the center of the room with their strange, sightless eyes. Raising his serpent wound staff and facing the chest of sombre marble, the priest called out in a voice that echoed and re echoed from every nook and cranny of the ancient temple:  Aradamas, come forth!  Then a strange thing happened.  The heavy slab that formed the cover of the great coffer slowly raised as though lifted by unseen hands and there emerged from its dark recesses a slim, white clad figure with his forearms crossed on his breast the figure of a man perhaps thirty years old, his long, black hair hanging down upon his white robed shoulders in strange contrast to the seamless garment that he wore.  His face, devoid of emotion, was as handsome and serene as the great face of Ammon Ra himself that gazed down upon the scene.  Silently Aradamas stepped from the ancient tomb and advanced slowly toward the high priest.  When about ten paces from the earthly representative of the gods, he paused, unfolded his arms, and extended them across his chest in salutation.  In one hand he carried a cross with a ring as the upper arm and this he proffered to the priest.  Aradamas stood in silence as the high priest, raising his sceptre to one of the great stone figures, addressed an invocation to the Sun God of the universe.  This finished, he then addressed the youthful figure as follows:  Aradamas, you seek to know the mystery of creation, you ask that the divine illumination of the Thrice Greatest and the wisdom that for ages has been the one gift the gods would shower upon mankind, be entrusted to you.  Little you understand of the thing you ask, but those who know have said that he who proves worthy may receive the truth.  Therefore, stand you here today to prove your divine birthright to the teaching that you ask.  The priest pronounced these words slowly and solemnly and then pointed with his sceptre to a great dim archway surmounted by a winged globe of gleaming gold.  Before thee, up those steps and through those passageways, lies the path that leads to the eye of judgment and the feet of Ammon Ra. Go, and if thy heart be pure, as pure as the garment that thou wearest, and if thy motive be unselfish, thy feet shall not stumble and thy being shall be filled with light.  But remember that Typhon and his hosts of death lurk in every shadow and that death is the result of failure.  Aradamas turned and again folded his arms over his breast in the sign of the cross. As he walked slowly through the somber arch, the shadows of the great Unknown closed over him who had dedicated his life to the search for the Eternal.  The priest watched him until he was lost to sight among the massive pillars beyond the shent span that divided the living from the dead.  Then slowly falling on his knees before the gigantic statue of Ra and raising his eyes to the shadows that through the long night conceal ed the face of the Sun God, he prayed that the youth might pass from the darkness of the temple pillars to the light he sought. It seemed that for a second a glow played around the face of the enormous statue and a strange hush of peace filled the ancient temple.  The high priest sensed this, for rising, he relighted his lamp and walked slowly away.  His beacon of light shone fainter and fainter in the distance, and finally was lost to view among the papyrus blooms of the temple pillars.  All that remained were the dying flames on the altar, which sent strange flickering glows over the great stone coffer and the twelve judges of the Egyptian dead. In the meantime, Aradamas, his hands still crossed on his breast, walked slowly onward and upward until the last ray from the burning altar fire was lost to view among the shadows far behind.  Through years of purification he had prepared himself for the great ordeal, and with a purified body and a balanced mind, he wended his way in and out amoung the pillars that loomed about him.  As he walked along, there seemed to radiate from his being a faint golden glow which illuminated the pillars as he passed the m.  He seemed a ghostly form amid a grove of ancient trees. Suddenly the pillars widened out to form another vaulted room, dimly lit by a reddish haze.  As Aradamas proceeded, there appeared around him swirling wisps of this scarlet light.  First they appeared as swiftly moving clouds, but slowly they took form, and strange misty figures in flowing draperies hovered in the air and held out long swaying arms to stay his progress.  Wraiths of ruddy mist hovered about him and whispered soft words into his ears, while weird music, like the voice of the storm and the cri es of night birds, resounded through the lofty halls.  Still Aradamas walked on calm and masterful, his fine, spiritual face outlined by his raven locks in strange contrast to the sinuous forms that gathered around and tried to lure him from his purpose.  Unmindful of strange forms that beckoned from ghostly archways and the pleading of soft voices, he passed steadily on his way with but one thought in his mind:  Fiat Lux!   Let there be light.  The ghastly music grew louder and louder, terminating at last in a mighty roar.  The very walls shook; the dancing forms swayed like flickering candle shadows and, still pleading and beckoning, vanished among the pillars of the temple. As the temple walls tottered, Aradamas paused; then with slow measured step he resumed his search for some ray of light, finding always darkness deeper than before.  Suddenly before him loomed another doorway, flanked on either side by an obelisk of carved marble, one black and the other white.  Through the doorway glowed a dim light, concealed by a gossamer veil of blue silk. As Aradamas slowly climbed the flight of steps leading to the doorway, there materialized upon the ground at his feet a swirl of lurid mist.  In the faint glow that it cast, it twisted like some oily gas, filling the entire chamber with a loathsome miasma.  Then out of this cloud issued a gigantic form   half human, half reptile.  In its bloodshot eyes burned ruddy pods of demon fire, while great claw like hands reached out to enfold and crush the slender figure that confronted it.  Aradamas wavered for a s ingle instant as the horrible apparition lunged forward, its size doubly magnified in the iridescent fog.  Then the white robed neophyte again slowly advanced, his arms still crossed on his breast.  He raised his fine face, illumined by a divine light, and courageously faced the hideous specter.  As he confronted the menacing form, for an instant it loomed over him like a towering demon.  Suddenly Aradamas raised the cross he carried and held it u p before the monster.  As he did so, the Crux Ansata gleamed with a wondrous golden light, which, striking the oily, scaly monster, seemed to dissolve its every particle into golden sparks.  As the last of the demon guardians vanished before the rays of the cross, a bolt of lightning flashed through the ancient hallways and, striking the veil that hung between the obelisks, rent it down the center and disclosed a vaulted chamber with a circular dome, dimly lighted by invisible lamps. Bearing his now flaming cross, Aradamas entered the room and instinctively gazed upward to the lofty dome.  There, floating in space, far above his head, he saw a great closed eye surrounded by fleecy clouds and rainbow colors.  Long Aradamas gazed upon the wonderful sight, for he knew that it was the Eye of Horus, the All Seeing Eye of the gods. As he stood there, he prayed that the will of the gods might be made known unto him and that in some way he might be found worthy to open that closed eye in the temple of the living God. As he stood there gazing upward, the eyelid flickered.  As the great orb slowly opened, the chamber was filled with a dazzling, blinding light that seemed to consume the very stones with fire. Aradamas staggered.  It seemed as if every atom of his being was scorched by the effulgence of that glow.  He instinctively closed his eyes and now he feared to open them, for in that terrific blaze of splendor it seemed that only blindness would follow his action. Little by little, a strange feeling of peace and ca lm descended upon him and at length he dared to open his eyes to find that the glare was gone, the entire chamber was bathed in a soft, wondrous glow from the mighty Eye in the ceiling.  The white robe he had worn had also given place to one of living fire which blazed as though with the reflection of thousands of lesser eyes from the divine orb above.  As his eyes became accustomed to the glow, he saw that he was no longer alone.  He was surrounded by twe lve white robed figures who, bowing before him, held up strange insignia wrought from living gold. As Aradamas looked, all the figures pointed, and as he followed the direction of their hands, he saw a staircase of living light that led far up into the dome and passed the Eye in the ceiling. With one voice, the twelve said:  Yonder lies the way of liberation.  Without a moment s hesitation, Aradamas mounted the staircase, and with feet that seemed to barely touch the steps, climbed upward into the dawn of a great unknown.  At last, after climbing many steps, he reached a doorway that opened as he neared it.  The breath of morning air fanned his cheek and a golden ray of sunshine played among the waves of his dark hair.  He stood on the top of a mighty pyramid, before him a blazing altar.  In the distance, far over the horizon, the rolling sands of the Egyptian de sert reflected the first rays of the morning sun which, like a globe of golden fire, rose again out of the eternal East.  As Aradamus stood there, a voice that seemed to issue from the very heavens chanted a strange song, and a hand, reaching out as it were from the globe of day itself, placed a serpent wrought of gyld upon the brow of the new initiate.  Behold Khepera, the rising sun! For as he brings the mighty globe of day out of the darkness of night, between his claws, so for thee the Sun of Spirit has risen from the darkness of night and in the name of the living God, we hail thee Priest of Ra.  SO MOTE IT BE ADDENDA THE ROBE OF BLUE AND GOLD Hidden in the depths of the unknown, three silent beings weave the endless thread of human fate.  They are called the Sisters, known to mythology as the Norns or Fates who incessantly twist between their fingers a tiny cord, which one day is to be woven into a living garment   the coronation robe of the priest king. To the mystics and philosophers of the world this garment is known under many names.  To some it is the simple yellow robe of Buddahood.  By the ancient Jews it was symbolized as the robe of the high priest, the Garment of Glory unto the Lord.  To the Masonic brethren, it is the robe of Blue and Gold   the Star of Bethlehem   the Wedding Garment of the Spirit. Three Fates weave the threads of this living garment, and man himself is the creator of his Fates.  The triple thread of thought, action, and desire binds him when he enters the sacred place or seeks admittance into the tiled lodge, but later this same cord is woven into a splendid garment whose purified folds clothe the sacred spark of his being. We all like to be well dressed.  Robes of velvet and ermine stand for symbols of rank and glory; but too many ermine capes have covered empty hearts, too many crowns have rested on the brows of tyrants.  These are symbols of earthly things and in the world of matter are too often misplaced.  The true coronation robe   the garment molded after the pattern of heaven, the robe of glory of the Master Mason   is not of the earth; for it tells of his spiritual growth, his deeper understanding, and his consecrated life.  The garments of the high priest of the tabernacle were but symbols of his own body, which, purified and transfigured, glorified the life within.  The notes of the tiny silver bells that tinkled with never ending music from the fringe of his vestments told of a life harmonious, while the breastplate which rested amid the folds of the ephod reflected the gleams of heavenly truth from the facets of its gems. There is another garment without a seam which we are told was often worn by the ancient brethren in the days of the Essenes, when the monastery of the lowly Nazarenes rose in silent grandeur from the steep sides of Mt. Tabor, to be reflected in the inscrutable waters of the Dead Sea.  This one piece garment is the spiral thread of human life which, when purified by right motive and right living, becomes a tiny thread of golden light, eternally weaving the purified garment of regenerated bodies.  Like the wh ite of the lambskin apron, it stands for the simple, the pure, and the harmless.  These are the requirements of the Master Mason, who must renounce forever this world s pomp and vanity and seek to weave that simple one piece robe of the soul which marks the Master, consecrated and consummated. With the eye of the mind we still can see the lowly Nazarene in his spotless robe of white   a garment no king s ransom could buy. This robe is woven out of the actions of our daily lives, each deed weaving into the endless pattern a thread, black or white, according to the motives which inspired our actions.  As the Master Mason labors in accordance with his vows, he slowly weaves this spotless robe out of the transmuted energy of his efforts.  It is this white robe which must be worn under the vestments of state, and whose spotless surface sanctifies him for the robes of glory, which can be worn only over the stainless, seamless garment of his purified life. When this moment arrives and the candidate has completed his task   when he comes purified and regenerated to the altar of wisdom, he is truly baptized of the fire and its flame blazes up within himself.  From him pour forth streams of light, and a great aura of multicolored fire bathes him with its radiance.  The sacred flame of the gods has found its resting place in him, and through him renews its covenant with man.  He is then truly a Freemason, a child of light.  This wonderful garment, of which all ea rthly robes are but symbols, is built of the highest qualities of human nature, the noblest of ideals, and the purest of aspirations.  Its coming is made possible only through the purification of body and unselfish service to others in the name of the Creator. When the Mason has built all these powers into himself, there radiates from him a wonderful body of living fire, like that which surrounded the Master Jesus, at the moment of His transfiguration. This is the Robe of Glory, the garment of Blue and Gold which, shining forth as a five pointed star of light, heralds the birth of the Christ within.  Man is then indeed a son of God, pouring forth from the depths of his own being the light rays which are the life of man. Striking hearts that have long been cold, this spiritual ray raises them from the dead.  It is the living light which illuminates those still buried in the darkness of materiality.  It is the power which raises by the strong grip of the lion s paw.  It is the Great Light which, seeking forever the spark of itself within all living things, reawakens dead ideals and smothered aspirations with the power of the Master s Eternal Word.  Then the Master Mason becomes indeed the Sun in Leo; and, reaching downward i nto the tomb of crystallization, raises the murdered Builder from the dead by the grip of the Master Mason. As the sun awakens the seedlings in the ground, so this Son of Man, glowing with the light divine, radiates from his own purified being the mystic shafts of redeeming light which awaken the seeds of hope and truth and a nobler life.  Discouragement and suffering too often brings down the temple, burying under its debris the true reason for being and the higher motives for living. As the glorious robe of the sun   the symbol of all life   bathes and warms creation with its glow, this same robe, enfolding all things, warms them and preserves them with its light and life.  Man is a god in the making, and as in the mystic myths of Egypt, on the potter s wheel he is being molded.  When his light shines out to lift and preserve all things, he receives the triple crown of godhood, and joins that throng of Master Masons who, in their robes of Blue and Gold, are seeking to dispel the darknes s of night with the triple light of the Masonic Lodge. Ceaselessly the Norns spin the thread of human fate.  Age in and age out, upon the looms of destiny are woven the living garments of God.  Some are rich in glorious colors and wondrous fabrics, while others are broken and frayed before they leave the loom.  All, however, are woven by these three Sisters   thought, action, and desire   with which the ignorant build walls of mud and bricks of slime between themselves and truth; while the pure of heart weave from these radiant threads garments of celestial bea uty. Do what we will, we cannot stop those nimble fingers which twist the threads, but we may change the quality of the thread they use. We should give these three eternal weavers only the noble and the true; then the work of their hands will be perfect.  The thread they twist may be red with the blood of others, or dark with the uncertainties of life; but if we resolve to be true, we may restore its purity and weave from it the seamless garment of a perfect life.  This is man s most acceptable gift upon the al tar of the Most High, his supreme sacrifice to the Creator. FRIENDSHIP What nobler relationship than that of friend? What nobler compliment can man bestow than friendship? The bonds and ties of the life we know break easily, but through eternity one bond remains   the bond of fellowship   the fellowship of atoms, of star dust in its endless flight, of suns and worlds, of gods and men. The clasped hands of comradeship unite in a bond eternal   the fellowship of spirit.  Who is more desolate than the friendless one? Who is more honored than one whose virtues have given him a fr iend? To have a friend is good, but to be a friend is better.  The noblest title ever given man, the highest title bestowed by the gods, was when the great Jove gazed down upon Prometheus and said,  Behold, a friend of man!  Who serves man, serves God.  This is the symbol of the fellowship of your Craft, for the plan of God is upheld by the clasped hands of friends. The bonds of relationship must pass, but the friend remains.  Serve God by being a friend,   a friend of the soul of man, serving his needs, li ghting his steps, smoothing his way.  Let the world of its own accord say of the Mason,  Behold the friend of all.  Let the world say of the Lodge,  This is indeed a fraternity of brothers, comrades in spirit and in truth.  THE EMERALD TABLET OF HERMES  TABULA SMARAGDINA  The Emerald Tablet of Hermes, illustrated on the opposite page, introduces us to Hiram, the hero of the Masonic legend.  The name Hiram is taken from the Chaldean Chiram.  The first two words in large print mean the secret work.  The second line in large letters   CHIRAM TELAT MECHASOT   means Chiram, the Universal Agent, one in Essence, but three in aspect.  Translated, the body of the Tablet reads as follows: It is true and no lie, certain, and to be depended upon, that the superior agrees with the inferior, and the inferior with the superior, to effect that one truly wonderful work.  As all things owe their existence to the will of the Only One, so all things owe their origin to One Only Thing, the most hidden, by the arrangement of the Only God.  The father of that One Only Thing is the Suit; its mother is the Moon; the wind carries it in its wings; but its nurse is a Spirituous Earth.  That One Only Thing  af ter God  is the father of all things in the universe.  Its power is perfect, after it has been united to a spirituous earth.  Separate that spirituous earth from the dense or crude earth by means of a gentle heat, with much attention.  In great measure it ascends from the earth up to heaven, and descends again, new born, on the earth, and the superior and inferior are increased in power. * * * By this thou wilt partake of the honors of the whole world an d darkness will fly from thee.  This is the strength o f all powers; with this thou wilt be able to overcome all things and to transmute all that is fine and all that is coarse.  In this manner the world was created, but the arrangements to follow this road are hidden.  For this reason I am called CHIRAM TELAT MECHASOT, one in Essence, but three in aspect.  In this Trinity is hidden the wisdom of the whole world.  It is ended now, what I have said concerning the effects of the Sun. FINISH OF THE TABULA SMARAGDINA In a rare, unpublished old manuscript dealing with early Masonic and Hermetic mysteries, we find the following information concerning the mysterious Universal Agent referred to as  Chiram   Hiram  : The sense of this Emerald Tablet can sufficiently convince us that the author was well acquainted with the secret operations of Nature and with the secret work of the philosophers  alchemists and Hermetists .  He likewise well knew and believed in the true God. It has been believed for several ages that Cham, one of the sons of Noah, is the author of this monument of antiquity.  A very ancient author, whose name is not known, who lived several centuries before Christ, mentions this tablet, and says that he had seen it in Egypt, at the court; that it was a precious stone, an emerald, whereon these characters were represented in bas relief, not engraved. He states that it was in his time esteemed over two thousand years old, and that the matter of this emerald had once been in a fluidic state like melted glass, and had been cast in a mold, and that to this flux the artist had given the hardness of a natural and genuine emerald, by  alchemical  art. The Canaanites were called the Phoenicians by the Greeks, who have told us that they had Hermes for one of their kings.  There is a definite relation between Chiram and Hermes. Chiram is a word composed of three words, denoting the Universal Spirit, the essence whereof the whole creation does consist, and the object of Chaldean, Egyptian, and genuine natural philosophy, according to its inner principles or properties.  The three Hebrew words Chamah, Rusch, and Majim, mean respectively Fire, Air, and Water, while their initial consonants, Ch, R, M, give us Chiram, that invisible essence which is the father of earth, fire, air and water; because, although immaterial in its own invis ible nature as the unmoved and electrical fire, when moved it becomes light and visible; and when collected and agitated, becomes heat and visible and tangible fire; and when associated with humidity it becomes material.  The word Chiram has been metamorphosed into Hermes and also into Herman, and the translators of the Bible have made Chiram by changing Chet into He; both of these Hebrew word signs being very similar. In the word Hermaphrodite,  a word invented by the old philosophers , we find Hermes changed to Herm, signifying Chiram, or the Universal Agent, and Aphrodite, the passive principle of humidity, who is also called Venus, and is said to have been produced and generated by the sea. We also read that Hiram  Chiram , or the Universal Agent, assisted King Solomon to build the temple.  No doubt as Solomon possessed wisdom, he understood what to do with the corporealized Universal Agent.  The Talmud of the Jews says that King Solomon built the temple by the assistance of Shamir.  Now this word signifies the sun, which is perpetually collecting the omnipresent, surrounding, electrical fire, or Spiritus Mundi, and sending it to us in the planets, in a visible manner called light. This electrical flame, corporealized and regenerated into the Stone of the Philosophers, enabled King Solomon to produce the immense quantities of gold and silver used to build and decorate his temple. These paragraphs from an ancient philosopher may assist the Masonic student of today to realize the tremendous and undreamed of shire of knowledge that lies behind the allegory which he often hears but seldom analyzes.  Hiram, the Universal Agent, might be translated Vita the power eternally building and unfolding the bodies of man. The use and abuse of energy is the keynote to the Masonic legend; in fact, it is the key to all things in Nature.  Hiram, as the triple energy, one in source but three in aspec t, can almost be called ether, that unknown hypothetical element which carries the impulses of the gods through the macrocosmic nervous system of the Infinite; for like Hermes, or Mercury, who was the messenger of the gods, ether carries impulses upon its wings.  The solving of the mystery of ether   or, if you prefer to call it vibrant space   is the great problem of Masonry.  This ether, as a hypothetical medium, brings energy to the three bodies of thought, emotion, and action, in this manner Chiram, the one in essence, becoming three in aspect   mental, emotional, and vital. The work which follows is an effort to bring to light other forgotten and neglected elements of the Masonic rites, and to emphasize the spirit of Hiram as the Universal Agent. Freemasonry is essentially mysterious, ritualistic, and ceremonial, representing abstract truth in concrete form.  Earth  or substance  smothering energy  or vitality  is the mystery behind the murder of the Builder. MOTIVE What motive leads the Masonic candidate out of the world and up the winding stairway to the light? He alone can truly know, for in his heart is hidden the motive of his works.  Is he seeking the light of the East? Is he seeking wisdom eternal? Does he bring his life and offer it upon the altar of the Most high? Of all things, motive is most important.  Though we fail again and again, it our motive be true, we are victorious.  Though time after time we succeed, if our motive be unworthy, we have failed.  Ent er the temple in reverence, for it is in truth the dwelling place of a Great Spirit, the Spirit of Masonry.  Masonry is an ordainer of kings.  Its hand has shaped the destinies of worlds, and the perfect fruitage of its molding is an honest man.  What nobler thing can be accomplished than the illumination of ignorance? What greater task is there than the joyous labor of service? And what nobler man can there be than that Mason who serves his Lights, and is himsel f a light unto his fellow men? This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters. Some have looked for shadows of the old illuminati; they look amiss, not seeing that which is all around them. If you know not the  who  and the  why , efforts will be mis directed. This is NOT a  conspiracy ..nay, it is a very cold and calculated NETWORK of individuals whose intent is nothing short of implementation of a  New World Order ; an oligarchic rein in which *you* serve as little more that slaves in their  technocracy . This network has every intention to implement a cashless society, for it is they who control every aspect of finance and banking over the entire globe. They have had about     years to perfect their plans and put them into practice.   Please understand that the Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tri lateral Commission,the Institute for Policy Studies, the Roundtables, the  Club of Rome ,etc are ALL bound by common denominators of long standing families ties, and interests and come together as a  single  policy making body that is known today as  The Committee of      . This has also been known as  The Olympians , the  Policy Committee .   Don t be mis led by labels such as  Rockefeller  or  Rothschild ; for these are simply the families who have the mechanisms of control already set in place,but of themselves are not the entire network; that being the  Committee of     . It is THEY who control the UN, who tell the heads of nations  when to jump and how high , they who are behind the world s illicit drug trade via the CIA and the old British East India links. They who manage the IMF,set policy at GATT conferences. It is they who ARE the  Shadow Government . It is they who manage the CIA,NSA,DIA..the same group that took out JFK and have MURDERED around     people in their efforts to suppress the truth about all the links..they who were behind the assassination of RFK,MLK..they who are behind the suppression of truth regarding the MIA s; It is the same group behind E. Howard Hunt, John Singlaub, Ollie North..the very same group who brought down Richard Nixon in Watergate..the same group behind the persecution of the Christic Institute..the same people who were behind Nugan Hand..the same group that groomed Jimmy Carter for the Presidency..the same group who ARE the  Military Industrial complex , the same group behind the total militarization of NASA..the same group who ARE  MJ    , were behind the  Jason Group ..the same behind Project Blue Book, The Condon Committee, the same who started up the NSA..who are responsible for the MURDER of Danny Casalaro..the same group responsible for the world wide DISINFO campaign regarding the TRUTH of UFO sightings and contacts. The very SAME group who OWN THE MEDIA..ie..The Washington Post, NBC  General Electric ,ABC,CBS,The New York Times,etc. The same group behind the the Warren Commission,ad nauseum..   I DO believe I could make a DIRECT connection here with just what  CIABASE says on WACKENHUT that also ties in the Shadow Government with UFO related installations; this is but *ONE* connection..there are many,many more that can be and will be ferreted out for exposure. ===== Begin Included article ============================================= Message #       INFO.PARANET     Date :    Jan      :      From : Don Ecker      To : John Galt Subject : Wackenhut John Galt said:  > Wackenhut Corp., one of the nation s largest security firms, said Friday  > it has bought the U.S. security operations of ISS International Service  > System Inc.

The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another war within the next five years. It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be   other Saddams  in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and  efficiently. The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United  Nations.  It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government by the year     .  A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to participate, based on parochial considerations,  said Henry Kissinger. If Americans can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,  parochial nationalism  in Briton, France and elsewhere will disappear, Bilderberg speakers said.  The Persian Gulf venture has advanced the cause by years  one speaker said.                                                      So there you have it, the  One Worlders  are still alive and well.

Just WHO makes up the ILLEGAL SHADOW GOVERMNENT,YOUR HIDDEN MASTERS? I ask no one to accept any of this at face value, and would heartily encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I ve provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this text.    And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich Winkel and others who have been showing you just *WHO* the CANCER IS.                                                                                  If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life s earnings,     the despoilers of our planet Earth, the deluders of our TV zombified     society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the Christic      Institute    than what refuge is left for the few remaining      Christic like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein     Monster government?  What refuge is left for you and me, and for our     children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and     spill their blood in the streets during the twenty first century?      It always degenerates to that, you know.     We Americans are a lazy, short sighted bunch. We realize that if we     don t earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we     don t brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We      realize that if we don t service our cars, they will fail to operate.     Yet, we don t realize    or we re too lazy to admit    that if we     don t supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure     that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power mad      neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power      and wealth vested in our Federal Government, then our libertarian      foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the     pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.     As we witness our free fall into the pit, we finally understand     that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children     will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover     our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through     television, that great national Svengali    that opiate of the masses      which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us     while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid     as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that      whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and     year after year, it s got to be costing you.       Why shouldn t we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are     the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so,      considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the      military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful       military force on the planet?  What s worse is that it s not just the     military that s militating against our Constitutional freedoms.     It s the military industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office     a third of a century ago by warning us that the military industrial     complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of     a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant      successor who tried to actually BE the President of the United States.     How knowledgeable was the General of the Army of the Second World War,     Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military industrial complex?     As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!     So you see, there really isn t much time left. If we prove to be too     lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the     Christic Institute    then our children in the twenty first century     will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the     Wackenhut Security Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida. Because     when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would      stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.     Ask the Palestinian people who stand up to bullets every day        or the Rumanian people, or the Guatemalan people, or the Filipino      people, or the Chinese people, or the Iranian people, or the     Tibetan people, or the Timorese people.     If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day     when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps     of the Gestapo who may finally come to kick down our front door and     arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms      that were once our heritage.             John DiNardo                                                                               Excerpted from the book,  Rape of The Constitution; Death of Freedom  by    Gyeorgos C. Hatonn .    *** The Rockefeller Syndicate ***   ========================================================================   Many American conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the    Rockefellers and the Council on Foreign Relations exercise absolute    control over the government and the people of the U.S.  This thesis can    be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger    issues.  Two writers for whom the present writer  E.M  has great respect,    Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the    Rockefellers and excluding all other aspects of the World Order. This    severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the    Medical Monopoly. This writer advanced a contrary view in  The World    Order,  fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point    of world control by     , and its London policy group, the Royal    Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has    essentially been, since     , a re established colonial government,    functions primarily through the Council on Foreign Relations, but only as    the subsidiary of RIIA and through the Rockefeller Foundation, which    controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media,    the religions and the state legislatures.     It is true that the American colonials have  free elections,  in which    they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates,    both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the Rockefeller    syndicate.  This touching evidence of  democracy  serves to convince most    Americans that you are indeed a free people.  You even have a cracked    Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to prove it.  American youths have been free    since      to be marched off to die in Hegelian wars in which both    combatants received their instructions from the World Order. You are free    to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value    of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve    System which is answerable only to the Bank of England. It has maintained    its vaunted  independence  from your government control, but this is the    only independence it has ever had.     The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the     Rockefeller Syndicate  can well be the starting point of the long road    back of a genuine struggle for American independence.  In exposing  the    Rockefellers  as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign    power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not    merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed    to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the    American people.  Thus the ancient calumny of John D. Rockefeller as a    man obsessed by greed  a category in which he has plenty of company     obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his    march towards a total oil monopoly in the United States from their    coffers at the National City Bank of Cleveland, Rockefeller was never an    independent power, nor does any department of the Rockefeller Syndicate    operate as an independent power.  You know that the Cosa Nostra, or    Mafia, with which the Syndicate is closely allied, has somewhat    autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that    particular  family  by the national directors, but this always implies    that that family remains under total control and answerable for    everything which occurs in its territory.     Similarly, the Rockefeller Syndicate operates under clearly defined    spheres of influence.  The  charitable  organizations, the business    companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation,    nor can any department of the Syndicate strike out on its own or    formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its    justification.     The Rockefeller Syndicate operates under the control of the world    financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets    could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.     This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the    organization.  Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would    be under contract for immediate assassination.  The Department of Justice    is well aware that the only  terrorists  operating in the United States    are the agents of the World Order, but they prudently avoid any mention    of this fact.     The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden    organization, is actually well known and well defined.  It consists of    the major Swiss Banks; the survivors of the old Venetian Genoese banking    axis; the Big Five of the world grain trade; the British combine,    centered in the Bank of England and its chartered merchant banks,    functioning through the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers and having    absolute control over their Canadian colony through the Royal Bank of    Canada and the Bank of Montreal, their Canadian lieutenants being the    Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the    colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by the Bank of England    through the Federal Reserve System; the Boston Brahmin families who made    their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and    the Rockefeller Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, the present    form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes    Kuhn,Loeb Company and Lehman Brothers.     It is notable that the Rockefeller Syndicate is far down on the list of    the worlds financial structure.  Why then is it of such importance?     Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the    Western Hemisphere, it is the actual working control mechanism of the    American colony.  The Rockefeller family themselves,like the    Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the    mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still    maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized.  Since he    set up the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller has functioned as a    sort of international courier for the World Order, principally concerned    with delivering working instructions to the Communist bloc,either    directly, in New York or by traveling to the area.  Laurence Rockefeller    is active in the operation of the Medical Monopoly, but his principal    interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas.  They    are the two survivors of the  Fortunate Five,  the five sons of John D.    Rockefeller, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. died in an    institution in Tucson,Arizona and was hastily cremated.  John D.    Rockefeller III died in a mysterious accident on a New York Parkway near    his home.  Nelson Rockefeller, named after his grandfather, died in the    arms of a TV journalist.  It was later revealed that he had also been in    the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed    up for many hours.  It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his    Columbian drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it    involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been    properly apportioned.  Winthrop Rockefeller died an alcoholic in the arms    of his black boy friend.  He had been interviewed on television by Harry    Reasoner to explain his hasty move from New York to Arkansas. Winthrop    learned that his black boy friend, an Army sergeant who apparently taught    him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in New York. To celebrate this    alliance, Winthrop Rockefeller gave magnificiently to Negro    causes,including the Urban League building on East   th Street in New    York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might    well have stated  From Hadrian to his Antinous.      We do not wish to imply that the Rockefellers no longer have influence,    but that the major policy dictates of the Rockefeller Syndicate are    handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.     Through the person of David Rockefeller, the family is sometimes called     the first family of the Soviet Union.  Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer,    the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their    private planes at the Moscow Airport. Others would suffer the fate of KAL       . David Rockefeller s most significant trip to the Soviet Union may    have been the fateful day when he landed in Moscow, having been told to    inform Khrushchev that he was  through . The Russians are very health    conscious, and a scientist had sent information to Khrushchev that the    use of chemical fertilizers in the Soviet Union presented a threat to the    people.  Khrushchev then announced a major change in the Soviet farm    policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals.  This was    upsetting to the head of the world s Chemical Fertilizer trust, David    Rockefeller, and he responded with a terse one word command,  Out .     Both the Rockefeller family fortune and the considerable portion set    aside in the foundations of the Rockefeller Syndicate are effectively    insulated against any type of government control.  FORTUNE magazine noted    August ,    , that John D. Rockefeller,Jr.  had created trusts in         which now amounted to some $ .  billion; another     million had been set    aside for the Abby Rockefeller branch.  The five sons had trusts which in         amounted to $ .  billion.  These trusts had originally amounted to    only $   million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as    inflation during the ensuing half century.  FORTUNE estimated the         total Rockefeller wealth as $ .  billion of which $    million was in    securities and real estate.  They owned   % of the Time Life    Building; Nelson Rockefeller s International Basic Economy Corporation had    been sold to a British company in     . For years, the Rockefeller family    had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, Rockefeller    Center, a $ .  billion investment yielding an annual return of  % . This    was a convenient manuever for tax purposes, and a good one at that.     Much of the Rockefeller wealth might be attributed to old John D. s    rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his    initial financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, which was    identified in Congressional reports as one of the three Rothschild banks    in the United States and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob    Schiff of Kuhn,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in    Franfort and was now the principal Rothschild representive  but unknown    as such to the public  in the United States.     With the seed money from the National City Bank in Cleveland, old John D.    Rockefeller soon laid claim to the title of the  most ruthless American .    It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the    Rothschilds to back him.  Rockefeller realized early in the game that the    oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time,    also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition.  His solution was a    simple one  crush all competition.  The famous Rockefeller dedication to    total monopoly was simply a business decision.  Rockefeller embarked on a    campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business.  He    attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be    entrepreneurs.  First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for    Rockefeller, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low    price,but offering cash.  If the offer was refused, the competitor would    then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut    his price.  He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which    would force him to shut down.  Control of labor through unions has always    been a basic Rockefeller technique.  Like the Soviet Union, they seldom    have labor trouble.  If these techniques failed, Rockefeller would then    be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival    workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the    competing refinery.     These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their    man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to Cleveland to    help Rockefeller plan further expansion.  At this time,the Rothschilds    controlled   % of all railroad mileage in the United States,through the    J.P. Morgan Company and Kuhn Loeb Company,according to official    Department of Commerce figures for the year     . J.P. Morgan mentions in    his  Who s Who  listing that he controlled   ,    miles of U.S.    railways.  Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for    Rockefeller,through a dummy corporation,South Improvement Company. These    rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition    with the Rockefeller firm.  The scheme was later exposed,but by that time    Rockefeller had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the    U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was    ruined by Rockefeller s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose    of the Standard Oil Trust. She was promptly denounced as a  muckracker     by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a  trustbuster.  In    fact, he ensured the dominance of the Standard Oil Trust and other giant    trusts.     During the next half century, John D. Rockefeller was routinely    caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless    capitalist.  At the same time, he was the principal financier of the    world Communist movement, through a firm called American International    Company. Despite the fact that the House of Rothschild had already    achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively    against its two principal representatives,John D. Rockefeller and J.P.    Morgan.  One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs    appeared in TRUTH magazine,Dec   ,    , which pointed out that  Mr.    Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company     I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names    are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world  even    into your very vitamin supplement business! , which represents the    Rothschild interests on your side of the Atlantic. He is described as a    financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the    great impersonal power known as Standard Oil.   Note that the name of    Rockefeller was not mentioned in the quote.     Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for    the American public to accept the  fact  that the Rockefellers were the    preeminent power in your country.  This myth was actually clothed in the    apparel of power,the Rockefeller Oil Trust becoming the     military industrial complex  which assumed political control of the    nation; the Rockefeller Medical Monopoly attained control of the health    care of the nation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, a web of affiliated    tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and    educational life of the nation.  The myth succeeded in its goal of    camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds.     After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for    some twenty five years a new myth began to be noised about in American    conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.     This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing    crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples    of the world.  This  new  revelation was that a struggle to the death for    world power had developed between the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.    According to this startling development, one faction or the other,    depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the    Soviet Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the    overthrow of the other faction.  The sudden death of several members of    the Rockefeller family was cited as  proof  that such a struggle was    taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during    this  war.  This ignored the general understanding that Nelson    Rockefeller had been  eliminated  as the result of losing deposit slips    for several billion dollars of drugs from the Columbian cartel, or that    the other Rockefeller deaths showed no trace of a  Rothschild    connection.      Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades,    the writer  E.M. ,could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to    think that  the Rockefellers  were now trying to seize power from the    Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the Rockefeller    family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled    by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers    would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they    were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck.  They    had no ambitions of their own.  Nevertheless, many hopeful Americans    grasped at the will o the wisp notion the Rockefellers were now  good    Americans  who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds.    Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade    before being relegated to the curiosities of history.     Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S.    Army some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D.    Rockefeller also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold    unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the    initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly.  His interest in the    oil business was a natural one; his father,William Rockefeller had been     in oil  for years.  William Rockefeller had become an oil entrepreneur    after salt wells at Tarentum, near Pittsburgh, were discovered in      to    be flowing with oil.  The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to    bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes.  One of his earliest    wholesalers was William Rockefeller. The  medicine  was originally    labelled  Kier s Magic Oil . Rockefeller printed his own labels, using     Rock Oil  or  Seneca Oil , Seneca being the name of a well known Indian    Tribe. Rockefeller achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest    profits by advertising himself as  William Rockefeller, the Celebrated    Cancer Specialist .  It is understandable that his grandsons would become    the controlling power behind the scenes of the world s most famous cancer    treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable    contributions to those areas which only benefit the Medical Monopoly.    William Rockefeller spared no claim in his flamboyant career.  He    guaranteed  All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone . Such    were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that    he was able to retail it for $   a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two    month s wages.  The  cure  consisted of a few well known diuretics, which    had been diluted by water.  This carnival medicine show barker could    hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest    and the most profitable Medical Monopoly in recorded history.     As an itinerant  carnie , a traveling carnival peddler, William    Rockefeller had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable    family life.  His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has    inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a    father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D.    Rockefeller s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to    maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow Americans during almost a    century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up    from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in American    life.  This may have been a contributing factor  however, it is also    possible that he was totally evil.  It is hardly arguable that he is    probably one of the most Satanic figures in American history.  Evil being    defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away    from God as influenced through another.     It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any    prominent American family.  In the Rockefeller family, it was more than    true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the    precepts of the Will of Canaan throughout his career,  love robbery, love    lechery .  He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and    you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William    and Rockefeller and magically re emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of    Philadelphia, a name which he retained for the rest of his life.  An    investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer s New York World received a tip    that was followed up.  The World then disclosed that William Avery    Rockefeller had died May   ,      in Freeport, Illinois, where he was    interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston.     William Rockefeller s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his    preferred profession of horse thief.  As one who planned to be in the    next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion    to the back of his wagon and head for the open road.  It also played a    large part in his vocation as a woman chaser; he was described as being     woman mad .     On June   ,    , he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New    York; he later was found to be residing in Oswego, New York and was    forced once again to decamp for parts unknown.  He had no difficulty in    financing his woman chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous    cancer cure and from another product, his  Wonder Working Liniment ,    which he offered at only two dollars a bottle.  It consisted of crude    petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a    heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the     liniment . William Rockefeller s original miracle oil survived until    quite recently as a concoction called Nujol, consisting principally of    petroleum and peddled as a laxative.  It was well known that Nujol was    merely an advertising sobriquet meaning  new oil , as opposed apparently,    to  old oil .  Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of    fat soluble vitamins, it being a well established medical fact that    mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many    needed vitamins and other nutritional needs.  Its makers added carotine    as a sop to the health conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.     Nujol was manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey,    called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same    premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit.     Nujol was hawked from the Senate Office Building in Washington for years    during a more liberal interpretation of  conflict of interest .  In this    case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august    peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than    serving the Rockefellers.  He was a physician whom Rockefeller had    appointed as head of the New York State Department of Health and later    financed his campaign for the Senate.  Copeland s frank display of    commercialism amazed even the most blase  Washington reporters.     He devoted his Senate career to a daily program advertising Nujol. A    microphone was set up in his Senate office each morning, the first order    of business being the Nujol program, for which he was paid $  ,    a    year, an enormous salary in the      s and more than the salary of the    President of the United States. Senator Copeland s exploits earned him a    number of nicknames on Capital Hill. He was often called the Senator from    the American Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for    any program launched by the AMA and Morris Fishbein. More realistically,    he was usually referred to as  the Senator from Standard Oil . He could    be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit    of the Rockefeller monopoly.  During congressional debate on the Food and    Drug Act in     , he came under criticism from Congresswoman Leonor    Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the    bill on the Senate floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that    soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were    the nation s largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big    industries to fight the bill.  Congresswoman Sullivan complained that,     Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic.  The hair    dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous    products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label      but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk    container in which hair dye is shipped?      Just as the elder Rockefeller had spent his life in the pursuit of his    personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being    money mad instead of woman mad, totally committed to the pursuit of    ever increasing wealth and power.  However, the principal accomplishments    of the Rockefeller drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the    chartering of the foundations to gain power over American citizens,the    creation of the central bank, the Federal Reserve System, the backing of    the World Communist Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply,    all came from the Rothschilds or from their European employees.     We cannot find in the records of John D. Rockefeller that he originated    any of these programs.  The concept of the tax exempt charitable    foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in        . The Peabody Educational Foundation later became the Rockefeller    Foundation and many of you should recall that item.  Not that you might    have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as    such.     It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. Rockefeller could    have conceived of this devious twist.  A social historian has described    the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable    foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the    more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery    of the wheel or fire.  This new discovery was the concept developed by    the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that    they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese.  The    history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their    traps.  Socialism    indeed, any government program    is simply the rat    baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human.     Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking and Currency    Committee, noted from the floor of Congress that the establishment of the    Rockefeller Foundation effectively insulated Standard Oil from    competition.  The controlling stock had been removed from market    manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors.  It also relieved    Standard Oil from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added    burden on individual American taxpayers.  Although a Rockefeller relative    by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the    Senate, had pushed the General Education Board charter through Congress,    the Rockefeller Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.     Widespread criticism of Rockefeller s monopolistic practices was heard,    and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen    for what it was.  The charter was finally pushed through in       the    significant Masonic numeral            was also the year of the    progressive income tax and of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act .    Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, another Senator from Standard Oil     there were quite a few , ramrodded the Congressional approval of the    charter.  The charter was then signed by John D. Rockefeller, John D.    Rockefeller, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the Rockefeller    established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the    Rockefeller Institute, Starr Jameson, described in  Who s Who  as     personal counsel to John D. Rockefeller in his benevolences , and    Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University.     The Rockefeller Oil Monopoly is now     years old, yet in     , the    Supreme Court, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be    broken up.  The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the    Rockefeller interests.  The family retained a two per cent holding in    each of the  new  companies, while the Rockefeller foundations took a    three per cent holding in each company.  This gave them a five per cent    stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation    is usually sufficient to maintain working control.     The involvement of the Rockefellers in promoting the World Communist    Revolution also developed from their business interests.  There was never    any commitment to the Marxist ideology; like anything else, it was there    to be used.  At the turn of the century, Standard Oil was competing    fiercely with Royal Dutch Shell for control of the lucrative European    market.  Congressional testimony revealed that Rockefeller had sent large    sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the Communist Revolution    in     . His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the Japanese in    their war against Russia and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan    to Russia to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity    against the Czar.     When the      revolution failed, Lenin was placed  in storage  in    Switzerland until     . Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived    rent free on the Standard Oil property at Bayonne,New Jersey, its tank    field.  When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three    hundred Communist revolutionaries from the Lower East Side of New York.    Rockefeller obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson    and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to    Russia. For traveling expenses, Rockefeller placed a purse containing    $  ,    in Trotsky s pocket.     On April   ,    , when the ship stopped in Halifax, Canadian Secret    Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova    Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading    government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky s    release.  The Secret Service had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his    way to take Russia out of the war, freeing more German armies to attack    Canadian troups on the Western Front.     Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from London to the    Canadian Secret Service to free Trotsky at once   they ignored him.     Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of Rockefeller s    most faithful stooges, Canadian Minister Mackenzie King, who had long    been a  labor specialist  for the Rockefellers. King personally obtained    Trotsky s release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the    Rockefellers, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution.  Thus, Dr.    Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in Russia as the    friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the    Rockefellers in backing world Communism.     Although Communism, like other  isms , had origined with Marx s    association with the House of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent    support of John D.  Rockefeller because he saw Communism for what it is,    the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary    system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations    it emulates, is self perpetuating and eternal.  It was the logical    progression from his Standard Oil monopoly.     An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far reaching    corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug    and chemical cartel, I. G. Farben. Called  a state within a state  , it    was created in      as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien    Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. Farben, which simply meant     The Cartel . It had originated in     , when the six major chemical    companies in Germany began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel,    merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler ter Meer, and    Greisheim Electron.  The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came    from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their German banker, Max    Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, Hamburg. He later headed the German    Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to    the Kaiser.     When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not    exiled with him to Holland; instead he became the financial advisor to    the new government.     Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.     While representing Germany at the Paris Peace Conference, Max Warburg    spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg,    who, after drafting the Federal Reserve Act at Jekyll Island, had headed    the U.S. banking system during the war.  He was in Paris as Woodrow    Wilson s financial advisor.     I. G. Farben soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some    five hundred firms.  Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During    the period of the Weimar Republic, I.G. Farben officials,seeing the    handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler,    supplying much needed funds and political influence.     The success of the I.G. Farben cartel had aroused the interest of other    industrialists.  Henry Ford was favorably impressed and set up a German    branch of Ford Motor Company. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by    I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben then established an American subsidiary called    American I.G., in cooperation with Standard Oil of New Jersey. Its    directors included Walter Teagle, President of Standard Oil, Paul Warburg    of Kuhn,Loeb Company and Edsel Ford, representing the Ford interests.     John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, became the    attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between New York and Berlin on    cartel business.  His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the    $   million Teagle Foundation which was set up before Teagle s death.     Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network.     =============Continued in Rockefeller Syndicate Part  ===================      * Don Allen *                // Only     Tavistock + Esalen =  New Age  Internet: dona@bilver.uucp  \X/ Amiga     Rothschild + Rockefeller = FED UUCP: .uunet!peora!bilver!vicstoy!dona    UN + Maitreya =  Twilight Zone   A democracy cannot be both ignorant and free     Thomas Jefferson   EXPOSE: Rockefeller Syndicate   Secret Govt pt      K  This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters.

The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another war within the next five years. It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be   other Saddams  in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and  efficiently. The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United  Nations.  It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government by the year     .  A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to participate, based on parochial considerations,  said Henry Kissinger. If Americans can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,  parochial nationalism  in Briton, France and elsewhere will disappear, Bilderberg speakers said.  The Persian Gulf venture has advanced the cause by years  one speaker said.                                                      So there you have it, the  One Worlders  are still alive and well.

Just WHO makes up the ILLEGAL SHADOW GOVERMNENT,YOUR HIDDEN MASTERS? I ask no one to accept any of this at face value, and would heartily encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I ve provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this text.    And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich Winkel and others who have been showing you just *WHO* the CANCER IS.                                                                                  If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life s earnings,     the despoilers of our planet Earth, the deluders of our TV zombified     society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the Christic      Institute    than what refuge is left for the few remaining      Christic like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein     Monster government?  What refuge is left for you and me, and for our     children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and     spill their blood in the streets during the twenty first century?      It always degenerates to that, you know.     We Americans are a lazy, short sighted bunch. We realize that if we     don t earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we     don t brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We      realize that if we don t service our cars, they will fail to operate.     Yet, we don t realize    or we re too lazy to admit    that if we     don t supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure     that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power mad      neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power      and wealth vested in our Federal Government, then our libertarian      foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the     pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.     As we witness our free fall into the pit, we finally understand     that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children     will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover     our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through     television, that great national Svengali    that opiate of the masses      which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us     while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid     as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that      whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and     year after year, it s got to be costing you.       Why shouldn t we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are     the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so,      considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the      military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful       military force on the planet?  What s worse is that it s not just the     military that s militating against our Constitutional freedoms.     It s the military industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office     a third of a century ago by warning us that the military industrial     complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of     a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant      successor who tried to actually BE the President of the United States.     How knowledgeable was the General of the Army of the Second World War,     Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military industrial complex?     As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!     So you see, there really isn t much time left. If we prove to be too     lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the     Christic Institute    then our children in the twenty first century     will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the     Wackenhut Security Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida. Because     when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would      stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.     Ask the Palestinian people who stand up to bullets every day        or the Rumanian people, or the Guatemalan people, or the Filipino      people, or the Chinese people, or the Iranian people, or the     Tibetan people, or the Timorese people.     If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day     when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps     of the Gestapo who may finally come to kick down our front door and     arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms      that were once our heritage.             John DiNardo                                                                               Excerpted from the book,  Rape of The Constitution; Death of Freedom  by    Gyeorgos C. Hatonn .    *** The Rockefeller Syndicate ***   ========================================================================   Many American conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the    Rockefellers and the Council on Foreign Relations exercise absolute    control over the government and the people of the U.S.  This thesis can    be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger    issues.  Two writers for whom the present writer  E.M  has great respect,    Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the    Rockefellers and excluding all other aspects of the World Order. This    severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the    Medical Monopoly. This writer advanced a contrary view in  The World    Order,  fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point    of world control by     , and its London policy group, the Royal    Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has    essentially been, since     , a re established colonial government,    functions primarily through the Council on Foreign Relations, but only as    the subsidiary of RIIA and through the Rockefeller Foundation, which    controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media,    the religions and the state legislatures.     It is true that the American colonials have  free elections,  in which    they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates,    both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the Rockefeller    syndicate.  This touching evidence of  democracy  serves to convince most    Americans that you are indeed a free people.  You even have a cracked    Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to prove it.  American youths have been free    since      to be marched off to die in Hegelian wars in which both    combatants received their instructions from the World Order. You are free    to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value    of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve    System which is answerable only to the Bank of England. It has maintained    its vaunted  independence  from your government control, but this is the    only independence it has ever had.     The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the     Rockefeller Syndicate  can well be the starting point of the long road    back of a genuine struggle for American independence.  In exposing  the    Rockefellers  as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign    power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not    merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed    to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the    American people.  Thus the ancient calumny of John D. Rockefeller as a    man obsessed by greed  a category in which he has plenty of company     obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his    march towards a total oil monopoly in the United States from their    coffers at the National City Bank of Cleveland, Rockefeller was never an    independent power, nor does any department of the Rockefeller Syndicate    operate as an independent power.  You know that the Cosa Nostra, or    Mafia, with which the Syndicate is closely allied, has somewhat    autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that    particular  family  by the national directors, but this always implies    that that family remains under total control and answerable for    everything which occurs in its territory.     Similarly, the Rockefeller Syndicate operates under clearly defined    spheres of influence.  The  charitable  organizations, the business    companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation,    nor can any department of the Syndicate strike out on its own or    formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its    justification.     The Rockefeller Syndicate operates under the control of the world    financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets    could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.     This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the    organization.  Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would    be under contract for immediate assassination.  The Department of Justice    is well aware that the only  terrorists  operating in the United States    are the agents of the World Order, but they prudently avoid any mention    of this fact.     The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden    organization, is actually well known and well defined.  It consists of    the major Swiss Banks; the survivors of the old Venetian Genoese banking    axis; the Big Five of the world grain trade; the British combine,    centered in the Bank of England and its chartered merchant banks,    functioning through the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers and having    absolute control over their Canadian colony through the Royal Bank of    Canada and the Bank of Montreal, their Canadian lieutenants being the    Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the    colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by the Bank of England    through the Federal Reserve System; the Boston Brahmin families who made    their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and    the Rockefeller Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, the present    form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes    Kuhn,Loeb Company and Lehman Brothers.     It is notable that the Rockefeller Syndicate is far down on the list of    the worlds financial structure.  Why then is it of such importance?     Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the    Western Hemisphere, it is the actual working control mechanism of the    American colony.  The Rockefeller family themselves,like the    Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the    mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still    maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized.  Since he    set up the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller has functioned as a    sort of international courier for the World Order, principally concerned    with delivering working instructions to the Communist bloc,either    directly, in New York or by traveling to the area.  Laurence Rockefeller    is active in the operation of the Medical Monopoly, but his principal    interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas.  They    are the two survivors of the  Fortunate Five,  the five sons of John D.    Rockefeller, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. died in an    institution in Tucson,Arizona and was hastily cremated.  John D.    Rockefeller III died in a mysterious accident on a New York Parkway near    his home.  Nelson Rockefeller, named after his grandfather, died in the    arms of a TV journalist.  It was later revealed that he had also been in    the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed    up for many hours.  It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his    Columbian drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it    involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been    properly apportioned.  Winthrop Rockefeller died an alcoholic in the arms    of his black boy friend.  He had been interviewed on television by Harry    Reasoner to explain his hasty move from New York to Arkansas. Winthrop    learned that his black boy friend, an Army sergeant who apparently taught    him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in New York. To celebrate this    alliance, Winthrop Rockefeller gave magnificiently to Negro    causes,including the Urban League building on East   th Street in New    York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might    well have stated  From Hadrian to his Antinous.      We do not wish to imply that the Rockefellers no longer have influence,    but that the major policy dictates of the Rockefeller Syndicate are    handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.     Through the person of David Rockefeller, the family is sometimes called     the first family of the Soviet Union.  Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer,    the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their    private planes at the Moscow Airport. Others would suffer the fate of KAL       . David Rockefeller s most significant trip to the Soviet Union may    have been the fateful day when he landed in Moscow, having been told to    inform Khrushchev that he was  through . The Russians are very health    conscious, and a scientist had sent information to Khrushchev that the    use of chemical fertilizers in the Soviet Union presented a threat to the    people.  Khrushchev then announced a major change in the Soviet farm    policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals.  This was    upsetting to the head of the world s Chemical Fertilizer trust, David    Rockefeller, and he responded with a terse one word command,  Out .     Both the Rockefeller family fortune and the considerable portion set    aside in the foundations of the Rockefeller Syndicate are effectively    insulated against any type of government control.  FORTUNE magazine noted    August ,    , that John D. Rockefeller,Jr.  had created trusts in         which now amounted to some $ .  billion; another     million had been set    aside for the Abby Rockefeller branch.  The five sons had trusts which in         amounted to $ .  billion.  These trusts had originally amounted to    only $   million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as    inflation during the ensuing half century.  FORTUNE estimated the         total Rockefeller wealth as $ .  billion of which $    million was in    securities and real estate.  They owned   % of the Time Life    Building; Nelson Rockefeller s International Basic Economy Corporation had    been sold to a British company in     . For years, the Rockefeller family    had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, Rockefeller    Center, a $ .  billion investment yielding an annual return of  % . This    was a convenient manuever for tax purposes, and a good one at that.     Much of the Rockefeller wealth might be attributed to old John D. s    rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his    initial financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, which was    identified in Congressional reports as one of the three Rothschild banks    in the United States and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob    Schiff of Kuhn,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in    Franfort and was now the principal Rothschild representive  but unknown    as such to the public  in the United States.     With the seed money from the National City Bank in Cleveland, old John D.    Rockefeller soon laid claim to the title of the  most ruthless American .    It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the    Rothschilds to back him.  Rockefeller realized early in the game that the    oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time,    also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition.  His solution was a    simple one  crush all competition.  The famous Rockefeller dedication to    total monopoly was simply a business decision.  Rockefeller embarked on a    campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business.  He    attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be    entrepreneurs.  First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for    Rockefeller, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low    price,but offering cash.  If the offer was refused, the competitor would    then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut    his price.  He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which    would force him to shut down.  Control of labor through unions has always    been a basic Rockefeller technique.  Like the Soviet Union, they seldom    have labor trouble.  If these techniques failed, Rockefeller would then    be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival    workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the    competing refinery.     These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their    man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to Cleveland to    help Rockefeller plan further expansion.  At this time,the Rothschilds    controlled   % of all railroad mileage in the United States,through the    J.P. Morgan Company and Kuhn Loeb Company,according to official    Department of Commerce figures for the year     . J.P. Morgan mentions in    his  Who s Who  listing that he controlled   ,    miles of U.S.    railways.  Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for    Rockefeller,through a dummy corporation,South Improvement Company. These    rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition    with the Rockefeller firm.  The scheme was later exposed,but by that time    Rockefeller had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the    U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was    ruined by Rockefeller s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose    of the Standard Oil Trust. She was promptly denounced as a  muckracker     by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a  trustbuster.  In    fact, he ensured the dominance of the Standard Oil Trust and other giant    trusts.     During the next half century, John D. Rockefeller was routinely    caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless    capitalist.  At the same time, he was the principal financier of the    world Communist movement, through a firm called American International    Company. Despite the fact that the House of Rothschild had already    achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively    against its two principal representatives,John D. Rockefeller and J.P.    Morgan.  One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs    appeared in TRUTH magazine,Dec   ,    , which pointed out that  Mr.    Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company     I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names    are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world  even    into your very vitamin supplement business! , which represents the    Rothschild interests on your side of the Atlantic. He is described as a    financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the    great impersonal power known as Standard Oil.   Note that the name of    Rockefeller was not mentioned in the quote.     Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for    the American public to accept the  fact  that the Rockefellers were the    preeminent power in your country.  This myth was actually clothed in the    apparel of power,the Rockefeller Oil Trust becoming the     military industrial complex  which assumed political control of the    nation; the Rockefeller Medical Monopoly attained control of the health    care of the nation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, a web of affiliated    tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and    educational life of the nation.  The myth succeeded in its goal of    camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds.     After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for    some twenty five years a new myth began to be noised about in American    conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.     This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing    crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples    of the world.  This  new  revelation was that a struggle to the death for    world power had developed between the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.    According to this startling development, one faction or the other,    depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the    Soviet Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the    overthrow of the other faction.  The sudden death of several members of    the Rockefeller family was cited as  proof  that such a struggle was    taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during    this  war.  This ignored the general understanding that Nelson    Rockefeller had been  eliminated  as the result of losing deposit slips    for several billion dollars of drugs from the Columbian cartel, or that    the other Rockefeller deaths showed no trace of a  Rothschild    connection.      Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades,    the writer  E.M. ,could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to    think that  the Rockefellers  were now trying to seize power from the    Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the Rockefeller    family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled    by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers    would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they    were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck.  They    had no ambitions of their own.  Nevertheless, many hopeful Americans    grasped at the will o the wisp notion the Rockefellers were now  good    Americans  who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds.    Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade    before being relegated to the curiosities of history.     Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S.    Army some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D.    Rockefeller also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold    unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the    initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly.  His interest in the    oil business was a natural one; his father,William Rockefeller had been     in oil  for years.  William Rockefeller had become an oil entrepreneur    after salt wells at Tarentum, near Pittsburgh, were discovered in      to    be flowing with oil.  The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to    bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes.  One of his earliest    wholesalers was William Rockefeller. The  medicine  was originally    labelled  Kier s Magic Oil . Rockefeller printed his own labels, using     Rock Oil  or  Seneca Oil , Seneca being the name of a well known Indian    Tribe. Rockefeller achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest    profits by advertising himself as  William Rockefeller, the Celebrated    Cancer Specialist .  It is understandable that his grandsons would become    the controlling power behind the scenes of the world s most famous cancer    treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable    contributions to those areas which only benefit the Medical Monopoly.    William Rockefeller spared no claim in his flamboyant career.  He    guaranteed  All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone . Such    were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that    he was able to retail it for $   a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two    month s wages.  The  cure  consisted of a few well known diuretics, which    had been diluted by water.  This carnival medicine show barker could    hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest    and the most profitable Medical Monopoly in recorded history.     As an itinerant  carnie , a traveling carnival peddler, William    Rockefeller had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable    family life.  His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has    inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a    father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D.    Rockefeller s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to    maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow Americans during almost a    century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up    from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in American    life.  This may have been a contributing factor  however, it is also    possible that he was totally evil.  It is hardly arguable that he is    probably one of the most Satanic figures in American history.  Evil being    defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away    from God as influenced through another.     It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any    prominent American family.  In the Rockefeller family, it was more than    true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the    precepts of the Will of Canaan throughout his career,  love robbery, love    lechery .  He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and    you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William    and Rockefeller and magically re emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of    Philadelphia, a name which he retained for the rest of his life.  An    investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer s New York World received a tip    that was followed up.  The World then disclosed that William Avery    Rockefeller had died May   ,      in Freeport, Illinois, where he was    interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston.     William Rockefeller s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his    preferred profession of horse thief.  As one who planned to be in the    next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion    to the back of his wagon and head for the open road.  It also played a    large part in his vocation as a woman chaser; he was described as being     woman mad .     On June   ,    , he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New    York; he later was found to be residing in Oswego, New York and was    forced once again to decamp for parts unknown.  He had no difficulty in    financing his woman chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous    cancer cure and from another product, his  Wonder Working Liniment ,    which he offered at only two dollars a bottle.  It consisted of crude    petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a    heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the     liniment . William Rockefeller s original miracle oil survived until    quite recently as a concoction called Nujol, consisting principally of    petroleum and peddled as a laxative.  It was well known that Nujol was    merely an advertising sobriquet meaning  new oil , as opposed apparently,    to  old oil .  Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of    fat soluble vitamins, it being a well established medical fact that    mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many    needed vitamins and other nutritional needs.  Its makers added carotine    as a sop to the health conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.     Nujol was manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey,    called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same    premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit.     Nujol was hawked from the Senate Office Building in Washington for years    during a more liberal interpretation of  conflict of interest .  In this    case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august    peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than    serving the Rockefellers.  He was a physician whom Rockefeller had    appointed as head of the New York State Department of Health and later    financed his campaign for the Senate.  Copeland s frank display of    commercialism amazed even the most blase  Washington reporters.     He devoted his Senate career to a daily program advertising Nujol. A    microphone was set up in his Senate office each morning, the first order    of business being the Nujol program, for which he was paid $  ,    a    year, an enormous salary in the      s and more than the salary of the    President of the United States. Senator Copeland s exploits earned him a    number of nicknames on Capital Hill. He was often called the Senator from    the American Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for    any program launched by the AMA and Morris Fishbein. More realistically,    he was usually referred to as  the Senator from Standard Oil . He could    be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit    of the Rockefeller monopoly.  During congressional debate on the Food and    Drug Act in     , he came under criticism from Congresswoman Leonor    Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the    bill on the Senate floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that    soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were    the nation s largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big    industries to fight the bill.  Congresswoman Sullivan complained that,     Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic.  The hair    dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous    products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label      but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk    container in which hair dye is shipped?      Just as the elder Rockefeller had spent his life in the pursuit of his    personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being    money mad instead of woman mad, totally committed to the pursuit of    ever increasing wealth and power.  However, the principal accomplishments    of the Rockefeller drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the    chartering of the foundations to gain power over American citizens,the    creation of the central bank, the Federal Reserve System, the backing of    the World Communist Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply,    all came from the Rothschilds or from their European employees.     We cannot find in the records of John D. Rockefeller that he originated    any of these programs.  The concept of the tax exempt charitable    foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in        . The Peabody Educational Foundation later became the Rockefeller    Foundation and many of you should recall that item.  Not that you might    have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as    such.     It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. Rockefeller could    have conceived of this devious twist.  A social historian has described    the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable    foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the    more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery    of the wheel or fire.  This new discovery was the concept developed by    the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that    they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese.  The    history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their    traps.  Socialism    indeed, any government program    is simply the rat    baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human.     Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking and Currency    Committee, noted from the floor of Congress that the establishment of the    Rockefeller Foundation effectively insulated Standard Oil from    competition.  The controlling stock had been removed from market    manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors.  It also relieved    Standard Oil from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added    burden on individual American taxpayers.  Although a Rockefeller relative    by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the    Senate, had pushed the General Education Board charter through Congress,    the Rockefeller Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.     Widespread criticism of Rockefeller s monopolistic practices was heard,    and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen    for what it was.  The charter was finally pushed through in       the    significant Masonic numeral            was also the year of the    progressive income tax and of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act .    Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, another Senator from Standard Oil     there were quite a few , ramrodded the Congressional approval of the    charter.  The charter was then signed by John D. Rockefeller, John D.    Rockefeller, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the Rockefeller    established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the    Rockefeller Institute, Starr Jameson, described in  Who s Who  as     personal counsel to John D. Rockefeller in his benevolences , and    Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University.     The Rockefeller Oil Monopoly is now     years old, yet in     , the    Supreme Court, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be    broken up.  The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the    Rockefeller interests.  The family retained a two per cent holding in    each of the  new  companies, while the Rockefeller foundations took a    three per cent holding in each company.  This gave them a five per cent    stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation    is usually sufficient to maintain working control.     The involvement of the Rockefellers in promoting the World Communist    Revolution also developed from their business interests.  There was never    any commitment to the Marxist ideology; like anything else, it was there    to be used.  At the turn of the century, Standard Oil was competing    fiercely with Royal Dutch Shell for control of the lucrative European    market.  Congressional testimony revealed that Rockefeller had sent large    sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the Communist Revolution    in     . His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the Japanese in    their war against Russia and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan    to Russia to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity    against the Czar.     When the      revolution failed, Lenin was placed  in storage  in    Switzerland until     . Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived    rent free on the Standard Oil property at Bayonne,New Jersey, its tank    field.  When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three    hundred Communist revolutionaries from the Lower East Side of New York.    Rockefeller obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson    and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to    Russia. For traveling expenses, Rockefeller placed a purse containing    $  ,    in Trotsky s pocket.     On April   ,    , when the ship stopped in Halifax, Canadian Secret    Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova    Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading    government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky s    release.  The Secret Service had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his    way to take Russia out of the war, freeing more German armies to attack    Canadian troups on the Western Front.     Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from London to the    Canadian Secret Service to free Trotsky at once   they ignored him.     Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of Rockefeller s    most faithful stooges, Canadian Minister Mackenzie King, who had long    been a  labor specialist  for the Rockefellers. King personally obtained    Trotsky s release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the    Rockefellers, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution.  Thus, Dr.    Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in Russia as the    friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the    Rockefellers in backing world Communism.     Although Communism, like other  isms , had origined with Marx s    association with the House of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent    support of John D.  Rockefeller because he saw Communism for what it is,    the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary    system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations    it emulates, is self perpetuating and eternal.  It was the logical    progression from his Standard Oil monopoly.     An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far reaching    corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug    and chemical cartel, I. G. Farben. Called  a state within a state  , it    was created in      as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien    Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. Farben, which simply meant     The Cartel . It had originated in     , when the six major chemical    companies in Germany began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel,    merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler ter Meer, and    Greisheim Electron.  The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came    from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their German banker, Max    Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, Hamburg. He later headed the German    Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to    the Kaiser.     When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not    exiled with him to Holland; instead he became the financial advisor to    the new government.     Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.     While representing Germany at the Paris Peace Conference, Max Warburg    spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg,    who, after drafting the Federal Reserve Act at Jekyll Island, had headed    the U.S. banking system during the war.  He was in Paris as Woodrow    Wilson s financial advisor.     I. G. Farben soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some    five hundred firms.  Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During    the period of the Weimar Republic, I.G. Farben officials,seeing the    handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler,    supplying much needed funds and political influence.     The success of the I.G. Farben cartel had aroused the interest of other    industrialists.  Henry Ford was favorably impressed and set up a German    branch of Ford Motor Company. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by    I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben then established an American subsidiary called    American I.G., in cooperation with Standard Oil of New Jersey. Its    directors included Walter Teagle, President of Standard Oil, Paul Warburg    of Kuhn,Loeb Company and Edsel Ford, representing the Ford interests.     John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, became the    attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between New York and Berlin on    cartel business.  His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the    $   million Teagle Foundation which was set up before Teagle s death.     Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network.      The Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation.  It has no authority or obligation at all, unless as a contract between man and man.  And it does not so much as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing.  It purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago.   This essay was written in     .   And it can be supposed to have been a contract then only between persons who had already come to years of discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonable and obligatory contracts.  Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a small portion even of the people then existing were consulted on the subject, or asked, or permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any formal manner.  Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years.  AND THE CONSTITUTION, SO FAR AS IT WAS THEIR CONTRACT, DIED WITH THEM.  They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they COULD bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but  the people  THEN existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves.  Let us see.  Its language is:         We, the people of the United States  that is, the people         THEN EXISTING in the United States , in order to form a         more perfect union, insure domestic tranquility, provide         for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and         secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves AND OUR         POSTERITY, do ordain and establish this Constitution for         the United States of America. It is plain, in the first place, that this language, AS AN AGREEMENT, purports to be only what it at most really was, viz., a contract between the people then existing; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those then existing.  In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies that they had any right or power, to bind their  posterity  to live under it. It does not say that their  posterity  will, shall, or must live under it.  It only says, in effect, that their hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to their posterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety, tranquility, liberty, etc. Suppose an agreement were entered into, in this form:         We, the people of Boston, agree to maintain a fort on         Governor s Island, to protect ourselves and our         posterity against invasion. This agreement, as an agreement, would clearly bind nobody but the people then existing.  Secondly, it would assert no right, power, or disposition, on their part, to compel their  posterity  to maintain such a fort.  It would only indicate that the supposed welfare of their posterity was one of the motives that induced the original parties to enter into the agreement. When a man says he is building a house for himself and his posterity, he does not mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of binding them, nor is it to be inferred that he is so foolish as to imagine that he has any right or power to bind them, to live in it.  So far as they are concerned, he only means to be understood as saying that his hopes and motives, in building it, are that they, or at least some of them, may find it for their happiness to live in it. So when a man says he is planting a tree for himself and his posterity, he does not mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of compelling them, nor is it to be inferred that he is such a simpleton as to imagine that he has any right or power to compel them, to eat the fruit. So far as they are concerned, he only means to say that his hopes and motives, in planting the tree, are that its fruit may be agreeable to them. So it was with those who originally adopted the Constitution. Whatever may have been their personal intentions, the legal meaning of their language, so far as their  posterity  was concerned, simply was, that their hopes and motives, in entering into the agreement, were that it might prove useful and acceptable to their posterity; that it might promote their union, safety, tranquility, and welfare; and that it might tend  to secure to them the blessings of liberty.  The language does not assert nor at all imply, any right, power, or disposition, on the part of the original parties to the agreement, to compel their  posterity  to live under it.  If they had intended to bind their posterity to live under it, they should have said that their objective was, not  to secure to them the blessings of liberty,  but to make slaves of them; for if their  posterity  are bound to live under it, they are nothing less than the slaves of their foolish, tyrannical, and dead grandfathers. It cannot be said that the Constitution formed  the people of the United States,  for all time, into a corporation.  It does not speak of  the people  as a corporation, but as individuals.  A corporation does not describe itself as  we,  nor as  people,  nor as  ourselves.   Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any  posterity.   It supposes itself to have, and speaks of itself as having, perpetual existence, as a single individuality. Moreover, no body of men, existing at any one time, have the power to create a perpetual corporation.  A corporation can become practically perpetual only by the voluntary accession of new members, as the old ones die off.  But for this voluntary accession of new members, the corporation necessarily dies with the death of those who originally composed it. Legally speaking, therefore, there is, in the Constitution, nothing that professes or attempts to bind the  posterity  of those who established it. If, then, those who established the Constitution, had no power to bind, and did not attempt to bind, their posterity, the question arises, whether their posterity have bound themselves.  If they have done so, they can have done so in only one or both of these two ways, viz., by voting, and paying taxes. II. Let us consider these two matters, voting and tax paying, separately.  And first of voting. All the voting that has ever taken place under the Constitution, has been of such a kind that it not only did not pledge the whole people to support the Constitution, but it did not even pledge any one of them to do so, as the following considerations show.  . In the very nature of things, the act of voting could bind nobody but the actual voters.  But owing to the property qualifications required, it is probable that, during the first twenty or thirty years under the Constitution, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or perhaps twentieth of the whole population  black and white, men, women, and minors  were permitted to vote.  Consequently, so far as voting was concerned, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or twentieth of those then existing, could have incurred any obligation to support the Constitution. At the present time       , it is probable that not more than one sixth of the whole population are permitted to vote. Consequently, so far as voting is concerned, the other five sixths can have given no pledge that they will support the Constitution.  . Of the one sixth that are permitted to vote, probably not more than two thirds  about one ninth of the whole population  have usually voted. Many never vote at all.  Many vote only once in two, three, five, or ten years, in periods of great excitement. No one, by voting, can be said to pledge himself for any longer period than that for which he votes.  If, for example, I vote for an officer who is to hold his office for only a year, I cannot be said to have thereby pledged myself to support the government beyond that term.  Therefore, on the ground of actual voting, it probably cannot be said that more than one ninth or one eighth, of the whole population are usually under any pledge to support the Constitution.  In recent years, since     , the number of voters in elections has usually fluctuated between one third and two fifths of the populace.   . It cannot be said that, by voting, a man pledges himself to support the Constitution, unless the act of voting be a perfectly voluntary one on his part.  Yet the act of voting cannot properly be called a voluntary one on the part of any very large number of those who do vote.  It is rather a measure of necessity imposed upon them by others, than one of their own choice.  On this point I repeat what was said in a former number, viz.:          In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual         voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, EVEN FOR         THE TIME BEING.  On the contrary, it is to be considered         that, without his consent having even been asked a man         finds himself environed by a government that he cannot         resist; a government that forces him to pay money,         render service, and forego the exercise of many of his         natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments.  He         sees, too, that other men practice this tyranny over him         by the use of the ballot.  He sees further, that, if he         will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of         relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by         subjecting them to his own.  In short, he finds himself,         without his consent, so situated that, if he use the         ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it,         he must become a slave.  And he has no other alternative         than these two.  In self  defence, he attempts the         former.  His case is analogous to that of a man who has         been forced into battle, where he must either kill         others, or be killed himself.  Because, to save his own         life in battle, a man takes the lives of his opponents,         it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his         own choosing.  Neither in contests with the ballot            which is a mere substitute for a bullet    because, as         his only chance of self  preservation, a man uses a         ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one         into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily         set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against         those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of         numbers.  On the contrary, it is to be considered that,         in an exigency into which he had been forced by others,         and in which no other means of self defence offered, he,         as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was         left to him.          Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most         oppressive government in the world, if allowed the         ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of         thereby meliorating their condition.  But it would not,         therefore, be a legitimate inference that the government         itself, that crushes them, was one which they had         voluntarily set up, or even consented to.          Therefore, a man s voting under the Constitution of the         United States, is not to be taken as evidence that he         ever freely assented to the Constitution, EVEN FOR THE         TIME BEING.  Consequently we have no proof that any very         large portion, even of the actual voters of the United         States, ever really and voluntarily consented to the         Constitution, EVEN FOR THE TIME BEING.  Nor can we ever         have such proof, until every man is left perfectly free         to consent, or not, without thereby subjecting himself         or his property to be disturbed or injured by others.  As we can have no legal knowledge as to who votes from choice, and who from the necessity thus forced upon him, we can have no legal knowledge, as to any particular individual, that he voted from choice; or, consequently, that by voting, he consented, or pledged himself, to support the government. Legally speaking, therefore, the act of voting utterly fails to pledge ANY ONE to support the government.  It utterly fails to prove that the government rests upon the voluntary support of anybody.  On general principles of law and reason, it cannot be said that the government has any voluntary supporters at all, until it can be distinctly shown who its voluntary supporters are.  . As taxation is made compulsory on all, whether they vote or not, a large proportion of those who vote, no doubt do so to prevent their own money being used against themselves; when, in fact, they would have gladly abstained from voting, if they could thereby have saved themselves from taxation alone, to say nothing of being saved from all the other usurpations and tyrannies of the government.  To take a man s property without his consent, and then to infer his consent because he attempts, by voting, to prevent that property from being used to his injury, is a very insufficient proof of his consent to support the Constitution.  It is, in fact, no proof at all.  And as we can have no legal knowledge as to who the particular individuals are, if there are any, who are willing to be taxed for the sake of voting, we can have no legal knowledge that any particular individual consents to be taxed for the sake of voting; or, consequently, consents to support the Constitution.  . At nearly all elections, votes are given for various candidates for the same office.  Those who vote for the unsuccessful candidates cannot properly be said to have voted to sustain the Constitution. They may, with more reason, be supposed to have voted, not to support the Constitution, but specially to prevent the tyranny which they anticipate the successful candidate intends to practice upon them under color of the Constitution; and therefore may reasonably be supposed to have voted against the Constitution itself.  This supposition is the more reasonable, inasmuch as such voting is the only mode allowed to them of expressing their dissent to the Constitution.  . Many votes are usually given for candidates who have no prospect of success.  Those who give such votes may reasonably be supposed to have voted as they did, with a special intention, not to support, but to obstruct the exection of, the Constitution; and, therefore, against the Constitution itself.  . As all the different votes are given secretly  by secret ballot , there is no legal means of knowing, from the votes themselves, who votes for, and who votes against, the Constitution.  Therefore, voting affords no legal evidence that any particular individual supports the Constitution. And where there can be no legal evidence that any particular individual supports the Constitution, it cannot legally be said that anybody supports it.  It is clearly impossible to have any legal proof of the intentions of largealar one of them.  . There being no legal proof of any man s intentions, in voting, we can only conjecture them.  As a conjecture, it is probable, that a very large proportion of those who vote, do so on this principle, viz., that if, by voting, thest cases, wholly contingent upon the question whether, by means of the Constitution, they can make themselves masters, or are to be made slaves. Such contingent consent as that is, in law and reason, no consent at all.  . As everybody who supporMAKE HIMSELF PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTS OF HIS AGENTS, SO LONG AS THEY ACT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POWER HE DELEGATES TO THEM.   . As all voting is secret  by secret ballot , and as all secret governments are necessarily only secret bands of robbers, tyrants, and murderers, the general fact that our government is practically carried on by means of such voting, on murder, the rest of the people.  The simple fact of the existence of such a vand does nothing towards proving that  the people of the United States,  or any one of them, voluntarily supports the Constitution. For all the reasons that have now been given, voting furnishes no legal evidence as to who the particular individuals are  if there are any , who voluntarily support the Constitution.  It therefore furnishes no legal evidence that anybody supports it voluntarily. So far, therefore, as voting is concerned, the Constitution, legally speaking, has no supporters at all. And, as a matter of fact, there is not the slightest probability that the Constitution has a single bona fide supporter in the country.  That is to say, there is not the slightest probability that there is a single man in the country, who both understands what the Constitution really is, AND SINCERELY SUPPORTS IT FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS. The ostensible supporters of the Constitution, like the ostensible supporters of most other governments, are made up of three classes, viz.:   . Knaves, a numerous and active class, who see in the governmey can use for their own aggrandizement or wealth.   . Dupes    a large class, no doubt    each of whom, because he is allowed one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his own person and his own property, and because he is permitted to have the same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others, that others have in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid enough to imagine that he is a  free man,  a  sovereign ; that this is  a free government ;  a government of equal rights,   the best government on earth,      and such like abA class who have some appreciation of the evils of government, but either do not see how to get rid of them, or do not choose to so far sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously and earnestly to the work of making a change.                   Suppose it be  the best government on earth,  does that prove       its own goodness, or only the badness of all other       governments? III. The payment of taxes, being compulsory, of course furnishes no evidence that any one voluntarily supports the Constitution.  . It is true that the THEORY of our Constitution is, that all taxes are paid voluntarily; that our government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarily entered into by the people with each other; that that each man makes a free and purely voluntary contract with all others who are parties to the Constitution, to pay so much money for so much protection, the same as he does with any other insurance company; and that he is just as free not to be protected, and not to pay tax, as he is to pay a tax, and be protected. But this theory of our government is wholly different from the practical fact.  The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man:  Your money, or your life.   And many, if not most, taxes are paid under the compulsion of that threat. The government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place, spring upon him from the roadside, and, holding a pistol to his head, proceed to rifle his pockets.  But the robbery is none the less a robbery on that account; and it is far more dastardly and shameful. The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act.  He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit.  He does not pretend to be anything but a robber.  He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to be merely a  protector,  and that he takes men s money against their will, merely to enable him to  protect  those infatuated travellers, who feel perfectly able to protect themselves, or do not appreciate his peculiar system of protection.  He is too sensible a man to make such professions as these.  Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do.  He does not persist in following you on the road, against your will; assuming to be your rightful  sovereign,  on account of the  protection  he affords you.  He does not keep  protecting  you, by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money as often as he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and by branding you as a rebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your country, and shooting you down without mercy, if you dispute his authority, or resist his demands.  He is too much of a gentleman to be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villanies as these.  In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt to make you either his dupe or his slave. The proceedings of those robbers and murderers, who call themselves  the government,  are directly the opposite of these of the single highwayman. In the first place, they do not, like him, make themselves individually known; or, consequently, take upon themselves personally the responsibility of their acts.  On the contrary, they secretly  by secret ballot  designate some one of their number to commit the robbery in their behalf, while they keep themselves practically concealed.  They say to the person thus designated: Go to A      B     , and say to him that  the government  has need of money to meet the expenses of protecting him and his property. If he presumes to say that he, are permitted to vote; and thus to make themselves parts of, or  if they choose  opponents of, the government, for the time being.  But who of them do thus vote, and especially how each one votes  whether so as to aid or oppose the government , he does not know; the voting being all done secretly  by secret ballot .  Who, therefore, practically compose  the government,  for the time being, he has no means of knowing.  Of course he can make no contract with them, give them no consent, and make them no pledge.  Of necessity, therefore, his paying taxes to them implies, on his part, no contract, consent, or pledge to support them    that is, to support  the government,  or the Constitution.  . Not knowing who the particular individuals are, who call themselves  the government,  the taxpayer does not know whom he pays his taxes to.  All he knows is that a man comes to him, representing himself to be the agent of  the government     that is, the agent of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who have taken to themselves the title of  the government,  and have determined to kill everybody who refuses to give them whatever money they demand.  To save his life, he gives up his money to this agent.  But as this agent does not make his principals individually known to the taxpayer, the latter, after he has given up his money, knows no more who are  the government     that is, who were the robbers    than he did before. To say, therefore, that by giving up his money to their agent, he entered into a voluntary contract with them, that he pledges himself to obey them, to support them, and to give them whatever money they should demand of him in the future, is simply ridiculous.  . All political power, so called, rests practically upon this matter of money.  Any number of scoundrels, having money enough to start with, can establish themselves as a  government ; because, with money, they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort more money; and also compel general obedience to their will.  It is with government, as Caesar said it was in war, that money and soldiers mutually supported each other; that with money he could hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort money.  So these villains, who call themselves governments, well understand that their power rests primarily upon money.  With money they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort money.  And, when their authority is denied, the first use they always make of money, is to hire soldiers to kill or subdue all who refuse them more money. For this reason, whoever desires liberty, should understand these vital facts, viz.:   . That every man who puts money into the hands of a  government   so called , puts into its hands a sword which will be used against him, to extort more money from him, and also to keep him in subjection to its arbitrary will.   . That those who will take his money, without his consent, in the first place, will use it for his further robbery and enslavement, if he presumes to resist their demands in the future.  . That it is a perfect absurdity to suppose that any body of men would ever take a man s money without his consent, for any such object as they profess to take it for, viz., that of protecting him; for why should they wish to protect him, if he does not wish them to do so?  To suppose that they would do so, is just as absurd as it would be to suppose that they would take his moeny without his consent, for the purpose of buying food or clothing for him, when he did not want it.   . If a man wants  protection,  he is competent to make his own bargains for it; and nobody has any occasion to rob him, in order to  protect  him against his will.  . That the only security men can have for their political liberty, consists in their keeping their money in their own pockets, until they have assurances, perfectly satisfactory to themselves, that it will be used as they wish it to be used, for their benefit, and not for their injury.  . That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted for a moment, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support. These facts are all so vital and so self evident, that it cannot reasonably be supposed that any one will voluntarily pay money to a  government,  for the purpose of securing its protection, unless he first make an explicit and purely voluntary contract with it for that purpose. It is perfectly evident, therefore, that neither such voting, nor such payment of taxes, as actually takes place, proves anybody s consent, or obligation, to support the Constitution.  Consequently we have no evidence at all that the Constitution is binding upon anybody, or that anybody is under any contract or obligation whatever to support it.  And nobody is under any obligation to support it. IV. THE CONSTITUTION NOT ONLY BINDS NOBODY NOW, BUT IT NEVER DID BIND ANYBODY. It never bound anybody, because it was never agreed to by anybody in such a manner as to make it, on general principles of law and reason, binding upon him. It is a general principle of law and reason, that a WRITTEN instrument binds no one until he has signed it.  This principle is so inflexible a one, that even though a man is unable to write his name, he must still  make his mark,  before he is bound by a written contract.  This custom was established ages ago, when few men could write their names; when a clerk    that is, a man who could write    was so rare and valuable a person, that even if he were guilty of high crimes, he was entitled to pardon, on the ground that the public could not afford to lose his services.  Even at that time, a written contract must be signed; and men who could not write, either  made their mark,  or signed their contracts by stamping their seals upon wax affixed to the parchment on which their contracts were written. Hence the custom of affixing seals, that has continued to this time. The laws holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed, the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to sign it, or to bind himself by it.  And law and reason both give him until the last moment, in which to decide whether he will sign it, or not.  Neither law nor reason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, UNTIL IT IS WRITTEN; for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning.  And when it is written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its precise legal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he will agree to it or not.  And if he do not THEN sign it, his reason is supposed to be, that he does not choose to enter into such a contract.  The fact that the instrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it, goes for nothing. Where would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring into court a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have it enforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that this other man had promised to sign it? that he ought to have signed it? that he had had the opportunity to sign it, if he would? but that he had refused or neglected to do so? Yet that is the most that could ever be said of the Constitution.     The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority from the Constitution    from an instrument that nobody ever signed    would spurn any other instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them for adjudication.                   The very men who drafted it, never signed it in any way to       bind themselves by it, AS A CONTRACT.  And not one of them       probably ever would have signed it in any way to bind himself       by it, AS A CONTRACT. Moreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, but must also be delivered to the party  or to some one for him , in whose favor it is made, before it can bind the party making it.  The signing is of no effect, unless the instrument be also delivered.  And a party is at perfect liberty to refuse to deliver a written instrument, after he has signed it.  The Constitution was not only never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody, or to anybody s agent or attorney.  It can therefore be of no more validity as a contract, then can any other instrument that was never signed or delivered. V. As further evidence of the general sense of mankind, as to the practical necessity there is that all men s IMPORTANT contracts, especially those of a permanent nature, should be both written and signed, the following facts are pertinent. For nearly two hundred years    that is, since         there has been on the statute book of England, and the same, in substance, if not precisely in letter, has been re enacted, and is now in force, in nearly or quite all the States of this Union, a statute, the general object of which is to declare that no action shall be brought to enforce contracts of the more important class, UNLESS THEY ARE PUT IN WRITING, AND SIGNED BY THE PARTIES TO BE HELD CHARGEABLE UPON THEM.  At this point there is a footnote listing    states whose statute books Spooner had examined, all of which had variations of this English statute; the footnote also quotes part of the Massachussetts statute.  The principle of the statute, be it observed, is, not merely that written contracts shall be signed, but also that all contracts, except for those specially exempted    generally those that are for small amounts, and are to remain in force for but a short time    SHALL BE BOTH WRITTEN AND SIGNED. The reason of the statute, on this point, is, that it is now so easy a thing for men to put their contracts in writing, and sign them, and their failure to do so opens the door to so much doubt, fraud, and litigation, that men who neglect to have their contracts    of any considerable importance    written and signed, ought not to have the benefit of courts of justice to enforce them.  And this reason is a wise one; and that experience has confirmed its wisdom and necessity, is demonstrated by the fact that it has been acted upon in England for nearly two hundred years, and has been so nearly universally adopted in this country, and that nobody thinks of repealing it. We all know, too, how careful most men are to have their contracts written and signed, even when this statute does not require it.  For example, most men, if they have money due them, of no larger amount than five or ten dollars, are careful to take a note for it.  If they buy even a small bill of goods, paying for it at the time of delivery, they take a receipted bill for it.  If they pay a small balance of a book account, or any other small debt previously contracted, they take a written receipt for it. Furthermore, the law everywhere  probably  in our country, as well as in England, requires that a large class of contracts, such as wills, deeds, etc., shall not only be written and signed, but also sealed, witnessed, and acknowledged.  And in the case of married women conveying their rights in real estate, the law, in many States, requires that the women shall be examined separate and apart from their husbands, and declare that they sign their contracts free of any fear or compulsion of their husbands. Such are some of the precautions which the laws require, and which individuals    from motives of common prudence, even in cases not required by law    take, to put their contracts in writing, and have them signed, and, to guard against all uncertainties and controversies in regard to their meaning and validity.  And yet we have what purports, or professes, or is claimed, to be a contract    the Constitution    made eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead, and who never had any power to bind US, but which  it is claimed  has nevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, and which  it is claimed  will be binding upon all the millions that are to come; but which nobody ever signed, se the folly and wickedness of mankind. VI. It is no exaggeration, but a literal truth, to say that, by the Constitution    NOT AS I INTERPRET IT, BUT AS IT IS INTERPRETED BY THOSE WH never be  questioned  as to any disposal they make of them. Thus the Constitution  Art. I, Sec.    provides that,  for any speech or debate  or vote , in either house, they  the senators and representatives  shall not be questioned in any other place.  The whole law making power is given to these senators and representatives  when acting by a two thirds vote ;     and this provision protects them from all responsibility for the laws they make.                   And this two thirds vote may be but two thirds of a quorum          that is two thirds of a majority    instead of two thirds of       the whole. The Constitution also enables them to secure the execution of all their laws, by giving them power to withhold the salaries of, and to impeach and remove, all judicial and executive officers, who refuse to execute them. Thus the whole power of the government is in their hands, and they are made utterly irresponsible for the use they make of it.  What is this but absolute, irresponsible power? It is no answer to this view of the case to say that these men are under oath to use their power only within certain limits; for what care they, or what should they care, for oaths or limits, when it is expressly provided, by the Constitution itself, that they shall never be  questioned,  or held to any resonsibility whatever, for violating their oaths, or transgressing those limits? Neither is it any answer to this view of the case to say that the men holding this absolute, irresponsible power, must be men chosen by the people  or portions of them  to hold it.  A man is none the less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years. Neither are a people any the less slaves because permitted periodically to choose new masters.  What makes them slaves is the fact that they now are, and are always hereafter to be, in the hands of men whose power over them is, and always is to be, absolute and irresponsible.                       Of what appreciable value is it to any man, as an individual,       that he is allowed a voice in choosing these public masters?       His voice is only one of several millions. The right of absolute and irresponsible dominion is the right of property, and the right of property is the right of absolute, irresponsible dominion. The two are identical; the one necessarily implies the other.  Neither can exist without the other.  If, therefore, Congress have that absolute and irresponsible law making power, which the Constitution    according to their interpretation of it    gives them, it can only be because they own us as property. If they own us as property, they are our masters, and their will is our law.  If they do not own us as property, they are not our masters, and their will, as such, is of no authority over us. But these men who claim and exercise this absolute and irresponsible dominion over us, dare not be consistent, and claim either to be our masters, or to own us as property.  They say they are only our servants, agents, attorneys, and representatives.  But this declaration involves an absurdity, a contradiction.  No man can be my servant, agent, attorney, or representative, and be, at the same time, uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me for his acts. It is of no importance that I appointed him, and put all power in his hands.  If I made him uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me, he is no longer my servant, agent, attorney, or representative. If I gave him absolute, irresponsible power over my property, I gave him the property.  If I gave him absolute, irresponsible power over myself, I made him my master, and gave myself to him as a slave. And it is of no importance whether I called him master or servant, agent or owner.  The only question is, what power did I put in his hands? Was it an absolute and irresponsible one? or a limited and responsible one? For still another reason they are neither our servants, agents, attorneys, nor representatives.  And that reason is, that we do not make ourselves responsible for their acts.  If a man is my servant, agent, or attorney, I necessarily make myself responsible for all his acts done within the limits of the power I have intrusted to him.  If I have intrusted him, as my agent, with either absolute power, or any power at all, over the persons or properties of other men than myself, I thereby necessarily make myself responsible to those other persons for any injuries he may do them, so long as he acts within the limits of the power I have granted him.  But no individual who may be injured in his person or property, by acts of Congress, can come to the individual electors, and hold them responsible for these acts of their so called agents or representatives.  This fact proves that these pretended agents of the people, of everybody, are really the agents of nobody. If, then, nobody is individually responsible for the acts of Congress, the members of Congress are nobody s agents.  And if they are nobody s agents, they are themselves individually responsible for their own acts, and for the acts of all whom they employ.  And the authority they are exercising is simply their own individual authority; and, by the law of nature    the highest of all laws    anybody injured by their acts, anybody who is deprived by them of his property or his liberty, has the same right to hold them individually responsible, that he has to hold any other trespasser individually responsible.  He has the same right to resist them, and their agents, that he has to resist any other trespassers. VII. It is plain, then, that on general principles of law and reason    such principles as we all act upon in courts of justice and in common life    the Constitution is no contract; that it binds nobody, and never did bind anybody; and that all those who pretend to act by its authority, are really acting without any legitimate authority at all; that, on general principles of law and reason, they are mere usurpers, and that everybody not only has the right, but is morally bound, to treat them as such. If the people of this country wish to maintain such a government as the Constitution describes, there is no reason in the world why they should not sign the instrument itself, and thus make known their wishes in an open, authentic manner; in such manner as the common sense and experience of mankind have shown to be reasonable and necessary in such cases; AND IN SUCH MANNER AS TO MAKE THEMSELVES  AS THEY OUGHT TO DO  INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.  But the people have never been asked to sign it.  And the only reason why they have never been asked to sign it, has been that it has been known that they never would sign it; that they were neither such fools nor knaves as they must needs have been to be willing to sign it; that  at least as it has been practically interpreted  it is not what any sensible and honest man wants for himself; nor such as he has any right to impose upon others.  It is, to all moral intents and purposes, as destitute of obligations as the compacts which robbers and thieves and pirates enter into with each other, but never sign. If any considerable number of the people believe the Constitution to be good, why do they not sign it themselves, and make laws for, and administer them upon, each other; leaving all other persons  who do not interfere with them  in peace?  Until they have tried the experiment for themselves, how can they have the face to impose the Constitution upon, or even to recommend it to, others?  Plainly the reason for absurd and inconsistent conduct is that they want the Constitution, not solely for any honest or legitimate use it can be of to themselves or others, but for the dishonest and illegitimate power it gives them over the persons and properties of others.  But for this latter reason, all their eulogiums on the Constitution, all their exhortations, and all their expenditures of money and blood to sustain it, would be wanting. VIII. The Constitution itself, then, being of no authority, on what authority does our government practically rest?  On what ground can those who pretend to administer it, claim the right to seize men s property, to restrain them of their natural liberty of action, industry, and trade, and to kill all who deny their authority to dispose of men s properties, liberties, and lives at their pleasure or discretion? The most they can say, in answer to this question, is, that some half, two thirds, or three fourths, of the male adults of the country have a TACIT UNDERSTANDING that they will maintain a government under the Constitution; that they will select, by ballot, the persons to administer it; and that those persons who may receive a majority, or a plurality, of their ballots, shall act as their representatives, and administer the Constitution in their name, and by their authority. But this tacit understanding  admitting it to exist  cannot at all justify the conclusion drawn from it.  A tacit understanding between A, B, and C, that they will, by ballot, depute D as their agent, to deprive me of my property, liberty, or life, cannot at all authorize D to do so.  He is none the less a robber, tyrant, and murderer, because he claims to act as their agent, than he would be if he avowedly acted on his own responsibility alone. Neither am I bound to recognize him as their agent, nor can he legitimately claim to be their agent, when he brings no WRITTEN authority from them accrediting him as such.  I am under no obligation to take his word as to who his principals may be, or whether he has any.  Bringing no credentials, I have a right to say he has no such authority even as he claims to have: and that he is therefore intending to rob, enslave, or murder me on his own account. This tacit understanding, therefore, among the voters of the country, amounts to nothing as an authority to their agents. Neither do the ballots by which they select their agents, avail any more than does their tacit understanding; for their ballots are given in secret, and therefore in such a way as to avoid any personal responsibility for the acts of their agents. No body of men can be said to authorize a man to act as their agent, to the injury of a third person, unless they do it in so open and authentic a manner as to make themselves personally responsible for his acts.  None of the voters in this country appoint their political agents in any open, authentic manner, or in any manner to make themselves responsible for their acts. Therefore these pretended agents cannot legitimately claim to be really agents. Somebody must be responsible for the acts of these pretended agents; and if they cannot show any open and authentic credentials from their principals, they cannot, in law or reason, be said to have any principals. The maxim applies here, that what does not appear, does not exist.  If they can show no principals, they have none. But even these pretended agents do not themselves know who their pretended principals are.  These latter act in secret; for acting by secret ballot is acting in secret as much as if they were to meet in secret conclave in the darkness of the night.  And they are personally as much unknown to the agents they select, as they are to others.  No pretended agent therefore can ever know by whose ballots he is selected, or consequently who his real principles are.  Not knowing who his principles are, he has no right to say that he has any.  He can, at most, say only that he is the agent of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who are bound by that faith which prevails among confederates in crime, to stand by him, if his acts, done in their name, shall be resisted. Men honestly engaged in attempting to establish justice in the world, have no occasion thus to act in secret; or to appoint agents to do acts for which they  the principals  are not willing to be responsible. The secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and murderers.  Open despotism is better than this. The single despot stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My will is law: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my acts: The only arbiter I acknowledge is the sword: If anyone denies my right, let him try conclusions with me. But a secret government is little less than a government of assassins.  Under it, a man knows not who his tyrants are, until they have struck, and perhaps not then.  He may GUESS, beforehand, as to some of his immediate neighbors. But he really knows nothing. The man to whom he would most naturally fly for protection, may prove an enemy, when the time of trial comes. This is the kind of government we have; and it is the only one we are likely to have, until men are ready to say: We will consent to no Constitution, except such an one as we are neither ashamed nor afraid to sign; and we will authorize no government to do anything in our name which we are not willing to be personally responsible for. IX. What is the motive to the secret ballot?  This, and only this:  Like other confederates in crime, those who use it are not friends, but enemies; and they are afraid to be known, and to have their individual doings known, even to each other.  They can contrive to bring about a sufficient understanding to enable them to act in concert against other persons; but beyond this they have no confidence, and no friendship, among themselves. In fact, they are engaged quite as much in schemes for plundering each other, as in plundering those who are not of them.  And it is perfectly well understood among them that the strongest party among them will, in certain contingencies, murder each other by the hundreds of thousands  as they lately did do  to accomplish their purposes against each other.  Hence they dare not be known, and have their individual doings known, even to each other.  And this is avowedly the only reason for the ballot: for a secret government; a government by secret bands of robbers and murderers.  And we are insane enough to call this liberty!  To be a member of this secret band of robbers and murderers is esteemed a privilege and an honor! Without this privilege, a man is considered a slave; but with it a free man!  With it he is considered a free man, because he has the same power to secretly  by secret ballot  procure the robbery, enslavement, and murder of another man, and that other man has to procure his robbery, enslavement, and murder. And this they call equal rights! If any number of men, many or few, claim the right to govern the people of this country, let them make and sign an open compact with each other to do so.  Let them thus make themselves individually known to those whom they propose to govern.  And let them thus openly take the legitimate responsibility of their acts.  How many of those who now support the Constitution, will ever do this?  How many will ever dare openly proclaim their right to govern? or take the legitimate responsibility of their acts? Not one! X. It is obvious that, on general principles of law and reason, there exists no such thing as a government created by, or resting upon, any consent, compact, or agreement of  the people of the United States  with each other; that the only visible, tangible, responsible government that exists, is that of a few individuals only, who act in concert, and call themselves by the several names of senators, representatives, presidents, judges, marshals, treasurers, collectors, generals, colonels, captains, etc., etc. On general principles of law and reason, it is of no importance whatever that these few individuals profess to be the agents and representatives of  the people of the United States ; since they can show no credentials from the people themselves; they were never appointed as agents or representatives in any open, authentic manner; they do not themselves know, and have no means of knowing, and cannot prove, who their principals  as they call them  are individually; and consequently cannot, in law or reason, be said to have any principals at all. It is obvious, too, that if these alleged principals ever did appoint these pretended agents, or representatives, they appointed them secretly  by secret ballot , and in a way to avoid all personal responsibility for their acts; that, at most, these alleged principals put these pretended agents forward for the most criminal purposes, viz.: to plunder the people of their property, and restrain them of their liberty; and that the only authority that these alleged principals have for so doing, is simply a TACIT UNDERSTANDING among themselves that they will imprison, shoot, or hang every man who resists the exactions and restraints which their agents or representatives may impose upon them. Thus it is obvious that the only visible, tangible government we have is made up of these professed agents or representatives of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who, to cover up, or gloss over, their robberies and murders, have taken to themselves the title of  the people of the United States ; and who, on the pretense of being  the people of the United States,  assert their right to subject to their dominion, and to control and dispose of at their pleasure, all property and persons found in the United States. XI. On general principles of law and reason, the oaths which these pretended agents of the people take  to support the Constitution,  are of no validity or obligation.  And why?  For this, if for no other reason, viz., THAT THEY ARE GIVEN TO NOBODY.  There is no privity  as the lawyers say     that is, no mutual recognition, consent, and agreement    between those who take these oaths, and any other persons. If I go upon Boston Common, and in the presence of a hundred thousand people, men, women and children, with whom I have no contract upon the subject, take an oath that I will enforce upon them the laws of Moses, of Lycurgus, of Solon, of Justinian, or of Alfred, that oath is, on general principles of law and reason, of no obligation.  It is of no obligation, not merely because it is intrinsically a criminal one, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS GIVEN TO NOBODY, and consequently pledges my faith to nobody.  It is merely given to the winds. It would not alter the case at all to say that, among these hundred thousand persons, in whose presence the oath was taken, there were two, three, or five thousand male adults, who had SECRETLY    by secret ballot, and in a way to avoid making themselves INDIVIDUALLY known to me, or to the remainder of the hundred thousand    designated me as their agent to rule, control, plunder, and, if need be, murder, these hundred thousand people.  The fact that they had designated me secretly, and in a manner to prevent my knowing them individually, prevents all privity between them and me; and consequently makes it impossible that there can be any contract, or pledge of faith, on my part towards them; for it is impossible that I can pledge my faith, in any legal sense, to a man whom I neither know, nor have any means of knowing, individually. So far as I am concerned, then, these two, three, or five thousand persons are a secret band of robbers and murderers, who have secretly, and in a way to save themselves from all responsibility for my acts, designated me as their agent; and have, through some other agent, or pretended agent, made their wishes known to me.  But being, nevertheless, individually unknown to me, and having no open, authentic contract with me, my oath is, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity as a pledge of faith to them. And being no ther persons in the country, and, so far as they can, even in neighboring countries; and to kill every man who shall attempt to defend his person and property against their schemes of plunder and dominion.  Who these men are, INDIVIDUALLY, I have no certain means of knowing, for they sign no papers, and give no open, authentic evidence of their individual membership.  They are of making known, their individual membeship, otherwise than by giving their votes secretly for certain agents to do their will. \ But although these men are individually unknown, both to each other and to other persons, it is generally understood in the country that none but male persons, of the age of twenty one years and upwards, can be members.  It is also generally understood that ALL male persons, born in the country, having certain complexions, and  in some localities  certain amounts of property, and  in certain cases  even persons of foreign birth, aret it appears that usually not more than onehalf, two thirds, or in some cases, three fourths, of all who are thus permitted to become members of the band, ever exercise, or consequently prove, their actual membership, in the only mode in which they ordinarily can exercise or prove it, viz., by giving their votes secretly for the officers or agents of the band.  The number of these secret votes, so far as we have any account of them, varies greatly from year to year, thus tending to prove that the band, instead of being a permanent organization, is a merely PRO TEMPORE affair with those who choose to act with it for the time being. \ The gross number of these secret votes, or what purports to be their gross number, in different localities, is occasionally published.  Whether these reports are accurate or not, we have no means of knowing.  It is generally supposed that great frauds are often committed in depositing them.  They are understood to be received and counted by certain men, who are themselves appointed for that purpose by the same secret process by which all other officers and agents of the band are selected. to the reports of these receivers of votes  for whose accuracy or honesty, however, I cannot vouch , and according to my best knowledge of the whole number of male persons  in my district,  who  it is supposed  were permitted to vote, it would appear that one half, two thirds or three fourths actually did vote. Who the men were, individually, who cast these votes, I have no knowledge, for the whole thing was done secretly.  But of the secret votes thus given for what they call a  member of Congress,  the receivers reported that I had a majority, or at least a larger number than any other one person.  And it is only by virtue of such a designation that I am now here to act in concert with other persons similarly selected in other parts of the country. It is understood among those who sent me here, that all persons so selected, will, on coming together at the City of Washington, take an oath in each other s presence  to support the Constitution of the United States.   By this is meant a certain paper that was drawn up eighty years ago.  It was never signed by anybody, and apparently has no obligation, and never had any obligation, as a contract.  In fact, few persons ever read it, and doubtless much the largest number of those who voted for me and the others, never even saw it, or now pretend to know what it means. Nevertheless, it is often spoken of in the country as  the Constitution of the United States ; and for some reason or other, the men who sent me here, seem to expect that I, and all with whom I act, will swear to carry this Constitution into effect.  I am therefore ready to take this oath, and to co operate with all others, similarly selected, who are ready to take the same oath. This is the most that any member of Congress can say in proof that he has any constituency; that he represents anybody; that his oath  to support the Constitution,  IS GIVEN TO ANYBODY, or pledges his faith to ANYBODY.  He has no open, written, or other authentic evidence, such as is required in all other cases, that he was ever appointed the agent or representative of anybody.  He has no written power of attorney from any single individual. He has no such legal knowledge as is required in all other cases, by which he can identify a single one of those who pretend to have appointed him to represent them. Of course his oath, professedly given to them,  to support the Constitution,  is, on general principles of law and reason, an oath given to nobody.  It pledges his faith to nobody.  If he fails to fulfil his oath, not a single person can come forward, and say to him, you have betrayed me, or broken faith with me. No one can come forward and say to him: I appointed you my attorney to act for me.  I required you to swear that, as my attorney, you would support the Constitution.  You promised me that you would do so; and now you have forfeited the oath you gave to me.  No single individual can say this. No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can come forward and say to him: We appointed you our attorney, to act forus.  We required you to swear that, as our attorney, you would support the Constitution.  You promised us that you would do so; and now you have forfeited the oath you gave to us. No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can say this to him; because there is no such association or body of men in existence.  If any one should assert that there is such an association, let him prove, if he can, who compose it.  Let him produce, if he can, any open, written, or other authentic contract, signed or agreed to by these men; forming themselves into an association; making themselves known as such to the world; appointing him as their agent; and making themselves individually, or as an association, responsible for his acts, done by their authority.  Until all this can be shown, no one can say that, in any legitimate sense, there is any such association; or that he is their agent; or that he ever gave his oath to them; or ever pledged his faith to them. On general principles of law and reason, it would be a sufficient answer for him to say, to all individuals, and to all pretended associations of individuals, who should accuse him of a breach of faith to them: I never knew you.  Where is your evidence ior robbing other persons; or that I would take all the personal risk of the robberies, and pay over the proceeds to you, you were particularly simple.  As I took all the risk of my robberies, I propose to take all the profits.  Begone!  You are fools, as well as villains.  If I gave my oath to anybody, I gave it to other persons than you.  But I really gave it to nobody.  I o expected me to pay it over to you, you relied only upon that honor that is said to prevail among thieves.  You now understand that that is a very poor reliance.  I trust you may become wise enough to never rely upon it again.  If I have any duty in the matter, it is to give back the money to those from whom I took it; not to pay it over to villains such as you. XIII.   They are necessarily given to nobody; because there is no open, authentic association, to which they can join themselves; or to whom, as individuals, they can pledge their faith. No such association, or organization, as  the people of the United States,  having ever been formed by any open, written, authentic, or voluntary contract, there is, on general principles of law andly given only to the winds.  They cannt be said to be given to any man, or body of men, as individuals, because no man, or body of men, can come forward WITH ANY PROOF that the oaths were given to them, as individuals, or to any association of which they are members.  To say that there is a tacit understanding among a portion of the male adults of the country, that they will States to their dominion; but that they wil keep themselves personally concealed by doing all their acts secretly, is wholly insufficient, on general principles of law and reason, to prove the existence of any such association, or organization, as  the people of the United States ; or consequently to prove that the oaths of foreigners were given to any such association. Xbey the laws of Congress, support the Union, and the like, are of no validity.  Such oaths are invalid, not only because they were extorted by military power, and threats of confiscation, and because they are in contravention of men s natural right to do as they please about supporting the government, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVEN TO NOBODY.  They were nominally given to  the United States.  But being nominally given to  the United States,  they were necessarily given to nobody, because, on general principles of law and reason, there were no  United States,  to whom the oaths could be given.  That is to say, there was no open, authentic, avowed, legitimate association, corporation, or body of men, known as  the United States,  or as  the people of the United States,  to whom the oaths could have been given.  If anybody says there was such a corporation, let him state who were the individuals that composed it, and how and when they became a corporation.  Were Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C members of it?  If so, where are their signatures?  Where the evidence of their membership?  Where the record?  Where the open, authentic proof?  There is none.  Therefore, in law and reason, there was no such corporation. On general principles of law and reason, every corporation, association, or organized body of men, having a legitimate corporate existence, and legitimate corporate rights, must consist of certain known individuals, who can prove, by legitimate and reasonable evidence, their membership.  But nothing of this kind can be proved in regard to the corporation, or body of men, who call themselves  the United States.   Not a man of them, in all the Northern States, can prove by any legitimate evidence, such as is required to prove membership in other legal corporations, that he himself, or any other man whom he can name, is a member of any corporation or association called  the United States,  or  the people of the United States,  or, consequently, that there is any such corporation.  And since no such corporation can be proved to exist, it cannot of course be proved that the oaths of Southern men were given to any such corporation.  The most that can be claimed is that the oaths were given to a secret band of robbers and murderers, who called themselves  the United States,  and extorted those oaths.  But that is certainly not enough to prove that the oaths are of any obligation. XV. On general principles of law and reason, the oaths of soldiers, that they will serve a given number of years, that they will obey the the orders of their superior officers, that they will bear true allegiance to the government, and so forth, are of no obligation. Independently of the criminality of an oath, that, for a given number of years, he will kill all whom he may be commanded to kill, without exercising his own judgment or conscience as to the justice or necessity of such killing, there is this further reason why a soldier s oath is of no obligation, viz., that, like all the other oaths that have now been mentioned, IT IS GIVEN TO NOBODY.  There being, in no legitimate sense, any such corporation, or nation, as  the United States,  nor, consequently, in any legitimate sense, any such government as  the government of the United States,  a soldier s oath given to, or contract made with, such a nation or government, is necessarily an oath given to, or contract made with, nobody.  Consequently such an oath or contract can be of no obligation. XVI. On general principles of law and reason, the treaties, so called, which purport to be entered into with other nations, by persons calling themselves ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators of the United States, in the name, and in behalf, of  the people of the United States,  are of no validity.  These so called ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators, who claim to be the agents of  the people of the United States  for making these treaties, can show no open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole  people of the United States,  or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors and others to make treaties in the name of, or binding upon any one of,  the people of the United States,  or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors, secretaries, and others, in their name and behalf, to recognize certain other persons, calling themselves emperors, kings, queens, and the like, as the rightful rulers, sovereigns, masters, or representatives of the different peoples whom they assume to govern, to represent, and to bind. The  nations,  as they are called, with whom our pretended ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators profess to make treaties, are as much myths as our own.  On general principles of law and reason, there are no such  nations.   That is to say, neither the whole people of England, for example, nor any open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever, by any open, written, or other authentic contract with each other, formed themselves into any bona fide, legitimate association or organization, or authorized any king, queen, or other representative to make treaties in their name, or to bind them, either individually, or as an association, by such treaties. Our pretended treaties, then, being made with no legitimate or bona fide nations, or representatives of nations, and being made, on our part, by persons who have no legitimate authority to act for us, have instrinsically no more validity than a pretended treaty made by the Man in the Moon with the king of the Pleiades. XVII. On general principles of law and reason, debts contracted in the name of  the United States,  or of  the people of the United States,  are of no validity. It is utterly absurd to pretend that debts to the amount of twenty five hundred millions of dollars are binding upon thirty five or forty millions of people  the approximate national debt and population in      , when there is not a particle of legitimate evidence    such as would be required to prove a private debt    that can be produced against any one of them, that either he, or his properly authorized attorney, ever contracted to pay one cent. Certainly, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any number of them, ever separately or individually contracted to pay a cent of these debts. Certainly, also, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any number of them, every, by any open, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract, united themselves as a firm, corporation, or association, by the name of  the United States,  or  the people of the United States,  and authorized their agents to contract debts in their name. Certainly, too, there is in existence no such firm, corporation, or association as  the United States,  or  the people of the United States,  formed by any open, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract, and having corporate property with which to pay these debts. How, then, is it possible, on any general principle of law or reason, that debts that are binding upon nobody individually, can be binding upon forty millions of people collectively, when, on general and legitimate principles of law and reason, these forty millions of people neither have, nor ever had, any corporate property? never made any corporate or individual contract? and neither have, nor ever had, any corporate existence? Who, then, created these debts, in the name of  the United States ? Why, at most, only a few persons, calling themselves  members of Congress,  etc., who pretended to represent  the people of the United States,  but who really represented only a secret band of robbers and murderers, who wanted money to carry on the robberies and murders in which they were then engaged; and who intended to extort from the future people of the United States, by robbery and threats of murder  and real murder, if that should prove necessary , the means to pay these debts. This band of robbers and murderers, who were the real principals in contracting these debts, is a secret one, because its members have never entered into any open, written, avowed, or authentic contract, by which they may be individually known to the world, or even to each other.  Their real or pretended representatives, who contracted these debts in their name, were selected  if selected at all  for that purpose secretly  by secret ballot , and in a way to furnish evidence against none of the principals INDIVIDUALLY; and these principals were really known INDIVIDUALLY neither to their pretended representatives who contracted these debts in their behalf, nor to those who lent the money.  The money, therefore, was all borrowed and lent in the dark; that is, by men who did not see each other s faces, or know each other s names; who could not then, and cannot now, identify each other as principals in the transactions; and who consequently can prove no contract with each other. Furthermore, the money was all lent and borrowed for criminal purposes; that is, for purposes of robbery and murder; and for this reason the contracts were all intrinsically void; and would have been so, even though the real parties, borrowers and lenders, had come face to face, and made their contracts openly, in their own proper names. Furthermore, this secret band of robbers and murderers, who were the real borrowers of this money, having no legitimate corporate existence, have no corporate property with which to pay these debts. They do indeed pretend to own large tracts of wild lands, lying between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and between the Gulf of Mexico and the North Pole.  But, on general principles of law and reason, they might as well pretend to own the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans themselves; or the atmosphere and the sunlight; and to hold them, and dispose of them, for the payment of these debts. Having no corporate property with which to pay what purports to be their corporate debts, this secret band of robbers and murderers are really bankrupt.  They have nothing to pay with.  In fact, they do not propose to pay their debts otherwise than from the proceeds of their future robberies and murders.  These are confessedly their sole reliance; and were known to be such by the lenders of the money, at the time the money was lent.  And it was, therefore, virtually a part of the contract, that the money should be repaid only from the proceeds of these future robberies and murders.  For this reason, if for no other, the contracts were void from the beginning. In fact, these apparently two classes, borrowers and lenders, were really one and the same class.  They borrowed and lent money from and to themselves. They themselves were not only part and parcel, but the very life and soul, of this secret band of robbers and murderers, who borrowed and spent the money. Individually they furnished money for a common enterprise; taking, in return, what purported to be corporate promises for individual loans.  The only excuse they had for taking these so called corporate promises of, for individual loans by, the same parties, was that they might have some apparent excuse for the future robberies of the band  that is, to pay the debts of the corporation , and that they might also know what shares they were to be respectively entitled to out of the proceeds of their future robberies. Finally, if these debts had been created for the most innocent and honest purposes, and in the most open and honest manner, by the real parties to the contracts, these parties could thereby have bound nobody but themselves, and no property but their own.  They could have bound nobody that should have come after them, and no property subsequently created by, or belonging to, other persons. XVIII. The Constitution having never been signed by anybody; and there being no other open, written, or authentic contract between any parties whatever, by virtue of which the United States government, so called, is maintained; and it being well known that none but male persons, of twenty one years of age and upwards, are allowed any voice in the government; and it being also well known that a large number of these adult persons seldom or never vote at all; and that all those who do vote, do so secretly  by secret ballot , and in a way to prevent their individual votes being known, either to the world, or even to each other; and consequently in a way to make no one openly responsible for the acts of their agents, or representatives,    all these things being known, the questions arise:  WHO compose the real governing power in the country?  Who are the men, THE RESPONSIBLE MEN, who rob us of our property? Restrain us of our liberty?  Subject us to their arbitrary dominion? And devastate our hooms, and shoot us down by the hundreds of thousands, if we resist?  How shall we find these men?  How shall we know them from others?  How shall we defend ourselves and our property against them?  Who, of our neighbors, are members of this secret band of robbers and murderers?  How can we know which are THEIR houses, that we may burn or demolish them?  Which THEIR property, that we may destroy it?  Which their persons, that we may kill them, and rid the world and ourselves of such tyrants and monsters? These are questions that must be answered, before men can be free; before they can protect themselves against this secret band of robbers and murderers, who now plunder, enslave, and destroy them. The answer to these questions is, that only those who have the will and power to shoot down their fellow men, are the real rulers in this, as in all other  so called  civilized countries; for by no others will civilized men be robbed, or enslaved. Among savages, mere physical strength, on the part of one man, may enable him to rob, enslave, or kill another man.  Among barbarians, mere physical strength, on the part of a body of men, disciplined, and acting in concert, though with very little money or other wealth, may, under some circumstances, enable them to rob, enslave, or kill another body of men, as numerous, or perhaps even more numerous, than themselves.  And among both savages and barbarians, mere want may sometimes compel one man to sell himself as a slave to another.  But with  so called  civilized peoples, among whom knowledge, wealth, and the means of acting in concert, have becom diffusede; and who have invented such weapons and other means of defense as to render mere physical strength of less importance; and by whom soldiers in any requisite number, and other instrumentalities of war in any requisite amount, can always be had for money, the question of war, and consequently the question of power, is little else than a mere question of money.  As a necessary consequence, those who stand ready to furnish this money, are the real rulers.  It is so in Europe, and it is so in this country. In Europe, the nominal rulers, the emperors and kings and parliaments, are anything but the real rulers of their respective countries.  They are little or nothing else than mere tools, employed by the wealthy to rob, enslave, and  if need be  murder those who have less wealth, or none at all. The Rosthchilds, and that class of money lenders of whom they are the representatives and agents    men who never think of lending a shilling to their next door neighbors, for purposes of honest industry, unless upon the most ample security, and at the highest rate of interest    stand ready, at all times, to lend money in unlimited amounts to those robbers and murderers, who call themselves governments, to be expended in shooting down those who do not submit quietly to being robbed and enslaved. They lend their money in this manner, knowing that it is to be expended in murdering their fellow men, for simply seeking their liberty and their rights; knowing also that neither the interest nor the principal will ever be paid, except as it will be extorted under terror of the repetition of such murders as those for which the money lent is to be expended. These money lenders, the Rosthchilds, for example, say to themselves:  If we lend a hundred millions sterling to the queen and parliament of England, it will enable them to murder twenty, fifty, or a hundred thousand people in England, Ireland, or India; and the terror inspired by such wholesale slaughter, will enable them to keep the whole people of those countries in subjection for twenty, or perhaps fifty, years to come; to control all their trade and industry; and to extort from them large amounts of money, under the name of taxes; and from the wealth thus extorted from them, they  the queen and parliament  can afford to pay us a higher rate of interest for our money than we can get in any other way.  Or, if we lend this sum to the emperor of Austria, it will enable him to murder so many of his people as to strike terror into the rest, and thus enable him to keep them in subjection, and extort money from them, for twenty or fifty years to come.  And they say the same in regard to the emperor of Russia, the king of Prussia, the emperor of France, or any other ruler, so called, who, in their judgment, will be able, by murdering a reasonable portion of his people, to keep the rest in subjection, and extort money from them, for a long time to come, to pay the interest and the principal of the money lent him. And why are these men so ready to lend money for murdering their fellow men? Soley for this reason, viz., that such loans are considered better investments than loans for purposes of honest industry.  They pay higher rates of interest; and it is less trouble to look after them.  This is the whole matter. The question of making these loans is, with these lenders, a mere question of pecuniary profit.  They lend money to be expended in robbing, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men, solely because, on the whole, such loans pay better than any others.  They are no respecters of persons, no superstitious fools, that reverence monarchs.  They care no more for a king, or an emperor, than they do for a beggar, except as he is a better customer, and can pay them better interest for their money.  If they doubt his ability to make his murders successful for maintaining his power, and thus extorting money from his people in future, they dismiss him unceremoniously as they would dismiss any other hopeless bankrupt, who should want to borrow money to save himself from open insolvency. When these great lenders of blood money, like the Rothschilds, have loaned vast sums in this way, for purposes of murder, to an emperor or a king, they sell out the bonds taken by them, in small amounts, to anybody, and everybody, who are disposed to buy them at satisfactory prices, to hold as investments. They  the Rothschilds  thus soon get back their money, with great profits; and are now ready to lend money in the same way again to any other robber and murderer, called an emperor or king, who, they think, is likely to be successful in his robberies and murders, and able to pay a good price for the money necessary to carry them on. This business of lending blood money is one of the most thoroughly sordid, cold blooded, and criminal that was ever carried on, to any considerable extent, amongst human beings.  It is like lending money to slave traders, or to common robbers and pirates, to be repaid out of their plunder.  And the men who loan money to governments, so called, for the purpose of enabling the latter to rob, enslave, and murder their people, are among the greatest villains that the world has ever seen.  And they as much deserve to be hunted and killed  if they cannot otherwise be got rid of  as any slave traders, robbers, or pirates that ever lived. When these emperors and kings, so called, have obtained their loans, they proceed to hire and train immense numbers of professional murderers, called soldiers, and employ them in shooting down all who resist their demands for money.  In fact, most of them keep large bodies of these murderers constantly in their service, as their only means of enforcing their extortions.  There are now       , I think, four or five millions of these professional murderers constantly employed by the so called sovereigns of Europe.  The enslaved people are, of course, forced to support and pay all these murderers, as well as to submit to all the other extortions which these murderers are employed to enforce. It is only in this way that most of the so called governments of Europe are maintained.  These so called governments are in reality only great bands of robbers and murderers, organized, disciplined, and constantly on the alert. And the so called sovereigns, in these different governments, are simply the heads, or chiefs, of different bands of robbers and murderers.  And these heads or chiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood money for the means to carry on their robberies and murders.  They could not sustain themselves a moment but for the loans made to them by these blood money loan mongers. And their first care is to maintain their credit with them; for they know their end is come, the instant their credit with them fails.  Consequently the first proceeds of their extortions are scrupulously applied to the payment of the interest on their loans. In addition to paying the interest on their bonds, they perhaps grant to the holders of them great monopolies in banking, like the Banks of England, of France, and of Vienna; with the agreement that these banks shall furnish money whenever, in sudden emergencies, it may be necessary to shoot down more of their people.  Perhaps also, by means of tariffs on competing imports, they give great monopolies to certain branches of industry, in which these lenders of blood money are engaged.  They also, by unequal taxation, exempt wholly or partially the property of these loan mongers, and throw corresponding burdens upon those who are too poor and weak to resist. Thus it is evident that all these men, who call themselves by the high sounding names of Emperors, Kings, Sovereigns, Monarchs, Most Christian Majesties, Most Catholic Majesties, High Mightinesses, Most Serene and Potent Princes, and the like, and who claim to rule  by the grace of God,  by  Divine Right     that is, by special authority from Heaven    are intrinsically not only the merest miscreants and wretches, engaged solely in plundering, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men, but that they are also the merest hangers on, the servile, obsequious, fawning dependents and tools of these blood money loan mongers, on whom they rely for the means to carry on their crimes.  These loan mongers, like the Rothschilds, laugh in their sleeves, and say to themselves: These despicable creatures, who call themselves emperors, and kings, and majesties, and most serene and potent princes; who profess to wear crowns, and sit on thrones; who deck themselves with ribbons, and feathers, and jewels; and surround themselves with hired flatterers and lickspittles; and whom we suffer to strut around, and palm themselves off, upon fools and slaves, as sovereigns and lawgivers specially appointed by Almighty God; and to hold themselves out as the sole fountains of honors, and dignities, and wealth, and power    all these miscreants and imposters know that we make them, and use them; that in us they live, move, and have their being; that we require them  as the price of their positions  to take upon themselves all the labor, all the danger, and all the odium of all the crimes they commit for our profit; and that we will unmake them, strip them of their gewgaws, and send them out into the world as beggars, or give them over to the vengeance of the people they have enslaved, the moment they refuse to commit any crime we require of them, or to pay over to us such share of the proceeds of their robberies as we see fit to demand. XIX. Now, what is true in Europe, is substantially true in this country. The difference is the immaterial one, that, in this country, there is no visible, permanent head, or chief, of these robbers and murderers who call themselves  the government.   That is to say, there is no ONE MAN, who calls himself the state, or even emperor, king, or sovereign; no one who claims that he and his children rule  by the Grace of God,  by  Divine Right,  or by special appointment from Heaven.  There are only certain men, who call themselves presidents, senators, and representatives, and claim to be the authorized agents, FOR THE TIME BEING, OR FOR CERTAIN SHORT PERIODS, OF ALL  the people of the United States ; but who can show no credentials, or powers of attorney, or any other open, authentic evidence that they are so; and who notoriously are not so; but are really only the agents of a secret band of robbers and murderers, whom they themselves do not know, and have no means of knowing, individually; but who, they trust, will openly or secretly, when the crisis comes, sustain them in all their usurpations and crimes. What is important to be noticed is, that these so called presidents, senators, and representatives, these pretended agents of all  the people of the United States,  the moment their exactions meet with any formidable resistance from any portion of  the people  themselves, are obliged, like their co robbers and murderers in Europe, to fly at once to the lenders of blood money, for the means to sustain their power.  And they borrow their money on the same principle, and for the same purpose, viz., to be expended in shooting down all those  people of the United States     their own constituents and principals, as they profess to call them    who resist the robberies and enslavements which these borrowers of the money are practising upon them.  And they expect to repay the loans, if at all, only from the proceeds of the future robberies, which they anticipate it will be easy for them and their successors to perpetrate through a long series of years, upon their pretended principals, if they can but shoot down now some hundreds of thousands of them, and thus strike terror into the rest. Perhaps the facts were never made more evident, in any country on the globe, than in our own, that these soulless blood money loan mongers are the real rulers; that they rule from the most sordid and mercenary motives; that the ostensible government, the presidents, senators, and representatives, so called, are merely their tools; and that no ideas of, or regard for, justice or liberty had anything to do in inducing them to lend their money for the war  i.e, the Civil War .  In proof of all this, look at the following facts. Nearly a hundred years ago we professed to have got rid of all that religious superstition, inculcated by a servile and corrupt priesthood in Europe, that rulers, so called, derived their authority directly from Heaven; and that it was consequently a religious duty on the part of the people to obey them.  We professed long ago to have learned that governments could rightfully exist only by the free will, and on the voluntary support, of those who might choose to sustain them.  We all professed to have known long ago, that the only legitimate objects of government were the maintenance of liberty and justice equally for all.  All this we had professed for nearly a hundred years.  And we professed to look with pity and contempt upon those ignorant, superstitious, and enslaved peoples of Europe, who were so easily kept in subjection by the frauds and force of priests and kings. Notwithstanding all this, that we had learned, and known, and professed, for nearly a century, these lenders of blood money had, for a long series of years previous to the war, been the willing accomplices of the slave holders in perverting the government from the purposes of liberty and justice, to the greatest of crimes. They had been such accomplices FOR A PURELY PECUNIARY CONSIDERATION, to wit, a control of the markets in the South; in other words, the privilege of holding the slave holders themselves in industrial and commercial subjection to the manufacturers and merchants of the North  who afterwards furnished the money for the war .  And these Northern merchants and manufacturers, these lenders of blood money, were willing to continue to be the accomplices of the slave holders in the future, for the same pecuniary considerations.  But the slave holders, either doubting the fidelity of their Northern allies, or feeling themselves strong enough to keep their slaves in subjection without Northern assistance, would no longer pay the price which these Northern men demanded.  And it was to enforce this price in the future    that is, to monopolize the Southern markets, to maintain their industrial and commercial control over the South    that these Northern manufacturers and merchants lent some of the profits of their former monopolies for the war, in order to secure to themselves the same, or greater, monopolies in the future.  These    and not any love of liberty or justice    were the motives on which the money for the war was lent by the North.  In short, the North said to the slave holders:  If you will not pay us our price  give us control of your markets  for our assistance against your slaves, we will secure the same price  keep control of your markets  by helping your slaves against you, and using them as our tools for maintaining dominion over you; for the control of your markets we will have, whether the tools we use for that purpose be black or white, and be the cost, in blood and money, what it may. On this principle, and from this motive, and not from any love of liberty, or justice, the money was lent in enormous amounts, and at enormous rates of interest.  And it was only by means of these loans that the objects of the war were accomplished. And now these lenders of blood money demand their pay; and the government, so called, becomes their tool, their servile, slavish, villanous tool, to extort it from the labor of the enslaved people both of the North and South.  It is to be extorted by every form of direct, and indirect, and unequal taxation. Not only the nominal debt and interest    enormous as the latter was    are to be paid in full; but these holders of the debt are to be paid still further    and perhaps doubly, triply, or quadruply paid    by such tariffs on imports as will enable our home manufacturers to realize enormous prices for their commodities; also by such monopolies in banking as will enable them to keep control of, and thus enslave and plunder, the industry and trade of the great body of the Northern people themselves.  In short, the industrial and commercial slavery of the great body of the people, North and South, black and white, is the price which these lenders of blood money demand, and insist upon, and are determined to secure, in return for the money lent for the war. This programme having been fully arranged and systematized, they put their sword into the hands of the chief murderer of the war,  undoubtedly a reference to General Grant, who had just become president  and charge him to carry their scheme into effect.  And now he, speaking as their organ, says,  LET US HAVE PEACE.  The meaning of this is:  Submit quietly to all the robbery and slavery we have arranged for you, and you can have  peace.   But in case you resist, the same lenders of blood money, who furnished the means to subdue the South, will furnish the means again to subdue you. These are the terms on which alone this government, or, with few exceptions, any other, ever gives  peace  to its people. The whole affair, on the part of those who furnished the money, has been, and now is, a deliberate scheme of robbery and murder; not merely to monopolize the markets of the South, but also to monopolize the currency, and thus control the industry and trade, and thus plunder and enslave the laborers, of both North and South. And Congress and the president are today the merest tools for these purposes.  They are obliged to be, for they know that their own power, as rulers, so called, is at an end, the moment their credit with the blood money loan mongers fails.  They are like a bankrupt in the hands of an extortioner.  They dare not say nay to any demand made upon them.  And to hide at once, if possible, both their servility and crimes, they attempt to divert public attention, by crying out that they have  Abolished Slavery!  That they have  Saved the Country!   That they have  Preserved our Glorious Union!  and that, in now paying the  National Debt,  as they call it  as if the people themselves, ALL OF THEM WHO ARE TO BE TAXED FOR ITS PAYMENT, had really and voluntarily joined in contracting it , they are simply  Maintaining the National Honor!  By  maintaining the national honor,  they mean simply that they themselves, open robbers and murderers, assume to be the nation, and will keep faith with those who lend them the money necessary to enable them to crush the great body of the people under their feet; and will faithfully appropriate, from the proceeds of their future robberies and murders, enough to pay all their loans, principal and interest. The pretense that the  abolition of slavery  was either a motive or justification for the war, is a fraud of the same character with that of  maintaining the national honor.   Who, but such usurpers, robbers, and murderers as they, ever established slavery?  Or what government, except one resting upon the sword, like the one we now have, was ever capable of maintaining slavery?  And why did these men abolish slavery?  Not from any love of liberty in general    not as an act of justice to the black man himself, but only  as a war measure,  and because they wanted his assistance, and that of his friends, in carrying on the war they had undertaken for maintaining and intensifying that political, commercial, and industrial slavery, to which they have subjected the great body of the people, both black and white.  And yet these imposters now cry out that they have abolished the chattel slavery of the black man    although that was not the motive of the war    as if they thought they could thereby conceal, atone for, or justify that other slavery which they were fighting to perpetuate, and to render more rigorous and inexorable than it ever was before.  There was no difference of principle    but only of degree    between the slavery they boast they have abolished, and the slavery they were fighting to preserve; for all restraints upon men s natural liberty, not necessary for the simple maintenance of justice, are of the nature of slavery, and differ from each other only in degree. If their object had really been to abolish slavery, or maintain liberty or justice generally, they had only to say:  All, whether white or black, who want the protection of this government, shall have it; and all who do not want it, will be left in peace, so long as they leave us in peace.  Had they said this, slavery would necessarily have been abolished at once; the war would have been saved; and a thousand times nobler union than we have ever had would have been the result.  It would have been a voluntary union of free men; such a union as will one day exist among all men, the world over, if the several nations, so called, shall ever get rid of the usurpers, robbers, and murderers, called governments, that now plunder, enslave, and destroy them. Still another of the frauds of these men is, that they are now establishing, and that the war was designed to establish,  a government of consent.   The only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this    that it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot.  This idea was the dominant one on which the war was carried on; and it is the dominant one, now that we have got what is called  peace.  Their pretenses that they have  Saved the Country,  and  Preserved our Glorious Union,  are frauds like all the rest of their pretenses.  By them they mean simply that they have subjugated, and maintained their power over, an unwilling people.  This they call  Saving the Country ; as if an enslaved and subjugated people    or as if any people kept in subjection by the sword  as it is intended that all of us shall be hereafter     could be said to have any country.  This, too, they call  Preserving our Glorious Union ; as if there could be said to be any Union, glorious or inglorious, that was not voluntary.  Or as if there could be said to be any union between masters and slaves; between those who conquer, and those who are subjugated. All these cries of having  abolished slavery,  of having  saved the country,  of having  preserved the union,  of establishing  a government of consent,  and of  maintaining the national honor,  are all gross, shameless, transparent cheats    so transparent that they ought to deceive no one    when uttered as justifications for the war, or for the government that has suceeded the war, or for now compelling the people to pay the cost of the war, or for compelling anybody to support a government that he does not want. The lesson taught by all these facts is this:  As long as mankind continue to pay  national debts,  so called    that is, so long as they are such dupes and cowards as to pay for being cheated, plundered, enslaved, and murdered    so long there will be enough to lend the money for those purposes; and with that money a plenty of tools, called soldiers, can be hired to keep them in subjection. But when they refuse any longer to pay for being thus cheated, plundered, enslaved, and murdered, they will cease to have cheats, and usurpers, and robbers, and murderers and blood money loan mongers for masters. APPENDIX. Inasmuch as the Constitution was never signed, nor agreed to, by anybody, as a contract, and therefore never bound anybody, and is now binding upon nobody; and is, moreover, such an one as no people can ever hereafter be expected to consent to, except as they may be forced to do so at the point of the bayonet, it is perhaps of no importance what its true legal meaning, as a contract, is. Nevertheless, the writer thinks it proper to say that, in his opinion, the Constitution is no such instrument as it has generally been assumed to be; but that by false interpretations, and naked usurpations, the government has been made in practice a very widely, and almost wholly, different thing from what the Constitution itself purports to authorize.  He has heretofore written much, and could write much more, to prove that such is the truth.  But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain    that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it.  In either case, it is unfit to exist.          This  has  been  a  tough  election and I m happy it s           over.  And we finally upset  that conservative  who has been           holding  up  all  the  progressive  legislation  for so many           years.                  Yes,  finally.   declared  the  financial  backer  and           mentor of  the new  Senator from  Wisconsin.    Now we ll be           able to get more  of  our  legislation  through  the Senate.           This has  been an  uphill battle  all the  way.  Old Charlie           Smith sure gave us an intense fight.   If we  hadn t had the           financial backing from so many of my friends, we never would           have unseated him.                 They called the Vice president  to administer  the oath           to the  newly elected Senator.  The ceremony was set for the            rd day of January in his freshly decorated office.  Present           for the  swearing in  was his family and several friends who           had arrived in Washington, D.C. only  the day  before.  They           were  thrilled  at  being  in  the Capitol building.  They d           heard so  much about  all the  pomp and  circumstance in our           Congress.  The Senator s wife and children were smiling from           ear to ear as was his mother.   She was  swelling with pride           over her son being elected to the United States Senate.                The Vice president joined the happy group.   Jack, I ve           come to administer the oath of  your office.   Hell,  I know           you believe in the Constitution, don t you?                  Yes Sir, of course.                 The  Vice president  shook  his  hand  and  immediately           walked over to offer his congratulations to Jack s family.                  While the local television  reporters were  present, no           one  questioned  that  the  oath  was not administered.  The           happy scene was simply one  of  mass  confusion.   Reporters           rushed forward  to shake  the hand  of the new Senator.  The           cameras swung around to the Vice president.   He  smiled and           said,  Welcome  to The  United States  Senate!   This is the           World s Most Exclusive Club.                   This performance is a continuing charade playing on the           ignorance  of  the  American  public.    The   World s  Most           Exclusive Club  has not  been legally  in session  since the           election following     .  How  bout that?                There have  been over seventy years of illegal legisla            tion and unconstitutional treaty verification.    + years of           unconstitutional confirmation of federal judges, ambassadors           and officers of the President s cabinet.   How  can this be?           Surely no  one in our government would allow such a practice           to continue if it were true.                Unfortunately, it is true.    Usually,  when  you don t           watch the  store . . . you get robbed.  And that is what has           happened to our government.   WE  haven t been  watching the           store.   The behind  the scene  power brokers have destroyed           the form of our  government.   There are  special checks and           balances  as  protections  which our Founding Fathers estab            lished at the Convention.                Two  branches  of  the  Congress  were  established  to                      protect the  sovereignty of  the states.   This  was a major           stumbling block in the writing  of  our  Constitution.   The           first  branch,  the  House  of  Representatives,  were to be           elected directly by the people.   The representation  in the           House  would  vary  according  to population.  This is still           true today.                The Senate, our second branch, was set up  to represent           state interests in the new government.  Each state has equal           representation and voice in national affairs.  Senators were           elected by  each respective state legislature.  Consequently           each state became an integral part  in the  formation of the           new national  government.  They designed this to be the link           between the state and national systems  of government.   One           advantage  to  this  system  was our Senators were less vul            nerable to graft and  control  by  persons  with  other than           honorable  motives.    Whenever state legislatures suspected           Senators were not watching out for  the state s  interest in           national affairs they were often replaced.                This was the check and balance against the first branch           which was elected by popular vote.    Documents Illustrative           of the  Formation of the Union of the American States, House           Document No.    ,   th Congress,  st Session,        .                This principle lasted until      .   The power managers           behind our government convinced the American people they had           more  wisdom  than  our  Founding  Fathers.    They  had  an           amendment  to  our  Constitution  introduced  into  Congress           proposing to give the election of  Senators directly  to the           people.  This amendment had the net effect of destroying the           sovereignty of state governments.                The Secretary of State made the announcement on May   ,               .   He declared  the amendment  ratified by the legisla            tures  of  thirty six  of  the  forth eight    sic   states.            ibid., footnote page     .                 Sounds innocent  enough, doesn t  it?  Sounds all legal           and constitutional.  This is what  dudes in  government want           you to  believe .  . .  but it s a lie, a fairy tale!  Let s           examine this sequence of errors.                In fancy and boldly  written letters,  the introductory           statement to  our Constitution  declares that  WE THE PEOPLE           established  the  Constitution  for  the  United  States  of           America.                The key is WE THE PEOPLE.  We granted permission to the           new government for certain specified and limited powers.  By           so doing, we granted the new government operating powers and           gave them  jurisdiction over  us.   The document  is full of            thou shalt  nots .  Powers which were not granted cannot be           assumed.   Nor can any powers which were granted be enlarged           or exceeded.                The  individual  states  were  really  jealous of their           sovereignty.  They all  feared the  powers given  to the new           national government  were not sufficiently restricted.  This           fear of the  smaller  states  of  domination  by  the larger           nearly wrecked the Constitutional Convention.  They demanded           a Bill of Rights be  added  to  the  new  constitution after                      ratification.                  The entire Bill of Rights will get a thorough examina            tion in  a later  paper.   For now,  let s concern ourselves           with one  which proves  NO authority  can be  assumed by the           national government    the  Tenth  amendment  clearly spells           out that  the powers  not delegated  belong to the states or           the people.                This amendment  is the  basis to  determine whether the           national government  has permission  to function  in a given           area.  If the power was not delegated by us  and spelled out           in the  document, they don t have it.  This amendment is the           one the  federal government  chooses to  ignore and probably           wishes did not exist.                Another basic assumption we have to acknowledge is only           we can agree to any changes in the  document.   Therefore we           are responsible  for the  operation of our government.  They           are responsible to us.                To be President of the United States, a  person MUST be           a natural born citizen of the United States.  Art II, Sec              This is a fixed, explicit command.  There  are NO exceptions           allowed.  No emergency allowances or amendment saying anyone           but a natural born citizen can  be president.   This  is the           only requirement  in the entire document that a candidate be           natural born.  It s obvious the Founders put it there  for a           specific purpose.                Philander C.  Knox, play  acting as Secretary of State,           introduced the   th amendment  into Congress  in     .   The           man  who  was  acting  as president was William Howard Taft.           Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on September   ,     .                SURPRISE . . . Ohio was NOT admitted to the Union until           August  ,      !   At the time Taft was elected to be presi            dent Ohio was simply a territory.  It was not  a state which           means he  was not  a natural born citizen.  Our Constitution           was violated.  He was not  eligible to  be president  by any           stretch of your imagination!                So our  illustrious Congress hits the panic button in a           frantic  effort  to  correct  a  major  mistake.    In their           infinite  wisdom ,  they passed a Joint Resolution admitting           Ohio as a full and equal member of  the union.    Public Law              ,   rd Congress,  st Session .                Section     of  that  resolution  states:    This joint           resolution shall take effect as of March  ,      .  Approved           August   ,      .     Quick  arithmetic  shows  that  to  be           backdated by     years.  That s ex post facto law.                They CAN T do it!  It s a conspicuous  violation of our           Constitution  which  states:     No  . . . ex post facto law           shall be passed.   Art I, Sec      This was added protection           for our  citizens.  An act which was legal one day could not           be declared illegal a day, a week, or even years  later.  NO           law can  be predated  by one  day.   We didn t  agree to any           change  through  the  amendment  process.    That guaranteed           protection of no ex post facto law is still the basic law of           the land.                Another problem surfaces under  this Public  Law.  They                      used  a  resolution  to  make  a  law when the intent of the           Founders was for only bills to become law.   Resolutions are           to express  an opinion  or to  censure some person or action           but were never to become law.                Taft was not president and his illegal lackeys  such as           Philander C Knox were not officials of the government.  They           introduced this  amendment illegally  into Congress.   It is           therefore an  unconstitutional act  and of no legal consequ            ence.                The election of Senators is as it was in the beginning,           by the  Legislatures of  the various  states, NOT by popular           vote.  They have not been in session legally since     .                Wait . . . there s more!   Let s  look at  the last two           lines of Article V of our Constitution.                 .  .  .  and  that no State, without its consent,                shall be deprived of  its  equal  Suffrage  in the                Senate.                 The  Secretary  of State  announced in      it had been           ratified by the legislatures  of  thirty six  of  the forty            eight states.                Article V  says    % of the states have to agree to any           change in their equal  voice  in  the  Senate.    Not three            quarters as  he announced.        PERCENT of the states must           agree.                Delaware and  Utah objected  to the  amendment and nine           other  states  did  not  act  on it.  Another section of the           Constitution was  violated in  defiance of  the authority we           granted.    Thirty six  states  have  forced a change on the           other states in their equal voting power in the Senate.                Some might say they  still  have  equal  suffrage since           there are two Senators from each state.   Sounds like a weak           bureaucratic argument.    However, they  no longer represent           primarily the  interest of  the state.   Now they supposedly           represent the interests of the people.   All  the states did           not agree to allow for a change of equal voting power.                 These acts  constitute usurpation of powers we granted.           For a definition of  usurpation, in  Black s Law Dictionary,           we find:    The  unlawful seizure or assumption of sovereign           power.  The assumption of  government  or  supreme  power by           force or illegally, in derogation of the constitution and of           the rights of the lawful ruler.                 Isn t this exactly what we  have  just  found  has been           happening to the authority we granted?                George  Washington,  in  his  Farewell Address made the           following remark:    Usurpation  is the  customary weapon by           which free  governments are  destroyed.   Another admonition           we have ignored.   Messages and Papers of the Presidents, J.           D. Richardson,                      To quote  Alexander Hamilton  in The Federalist Papers,           No.   :   There is  no  position  which  depends  on clearer           principles  than  that  every  act of a delegated authority,           contrary to the tenor  of the  commission under  which it is                      exercised, is  void.    What they  did is no good . . . they           broke the law.   All references to  paper no.  are from this           book.                 Hamilton goes  on further  in the  same paper to state:            To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy  is greater           than his  principle; that  the servant  is above his master;           that the representative of  the people  are superior  to the           people themselves;  that men  acting by virtue of powers may           do not  only what  their powers  do not  authorize, but what           they forbid.                 Madison, in  Paper No.    makes clear the reasoning for           the election of Senators by the states:   In this  spirit it           may be remarked that the equal vote allowed to each State is           at once  a  constitutional  recognition  of  the  portion of           sovereignty  remaining  in  the  individual  States  and  an           instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty.                  No law or resolution can  now  be  passed  without the           concurrence, first, of a majority of the people, and then of           a majority of the States.                 Presently, we no  longer  have  that  guarantee  of one           branch  of  the  Congress  watching the actions of the other           branch.   The established  check and  balance was destroyed.           These  people  now  go  willy nilly  passing  legislation in           direct contradiction to the intent of  our Founding Fathers.                As one obvious example, in      a money bill originated           in the Senate.  Can t be  done legally.   This  is in direct           violation of a crystal clear restriction in our Constitution           which  dictates:     All  Bills  for  raising  Revenue shall           originate in  the House  of Representatives;  but the Senate           may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.                 There was much heavy argument during the Constitutional           Convention on this very issue of money bills.                Is it becoming apparent that they now feel the servants           are above the masters?   After all, who in blazes are you?                  How do we correct this mess?  I will be  first to admit           it will  be difficult.   There  is no  question they will be           reluctant to give up their powers and positions.  They re on           the big  gravy train  and it s tough to derail.  Phone calls           and letters to the  offices  of  your  Senators  would  be a           start.    Letters  to  the  Editors of local newspapers will           alert other people.  Let s start putting up  some roadblocks           to derail that train.                Using Petitions  For Redress  of Grievances to Senators           and Representatives will be  a  good  tactic.    It  will be           interesting to see what they have to say about it.                State Legislatures will have to become involved in this           fight.  After  all,  it  was  their  power  in  the national           government  and  their  sovereignty  which  was  diluted and           destroyed.  I m also  certain they  know nothing  about this           issue at  present so  each citizen MUST question their state           representative.                  The states  were duped  into accepting  the   th Amend            ment.   The states who did not act on the ratification would           be the  logical ones  to initiate  the action.   They should                      force the  federales to  have the amendment set aside.  They           easily repealed the   th amendment  Prohibition   by Conven            tions in  the States.   We  have to start the action and get           our  government back  within the  confines of  the authority           which we granted!                The filing of a civil suit as a federal question action           in federal court would be another option.   The action would           have to  be directly  against the Senate for being illegally           in session.                The American people  have  the  intelligence, ingenuity           and backbone  to get  a job  done once  they are  aware of a           serious problem.  We are not a nation of wimps . . . not yet           anyway.   A comment  is necessary concerning our new Senator           not taking the required oath in our opening illustration.  I           personally have witnessed such an incident on local televis            ion news which concerned a newly elected Congressman.                This  business of  Congress  passing a law which is               years ex post facto has other serious ramifications.  I will           cover these in later papers.  More  surprises on the way and           it involves our friends at the IRS!                For now,  let s   get  our  Senate  back to it s proper           representation of each State s interest.  We are  being made           fools of by our national government.                Care to  check on how many treaties ratified since                are not constitutionally  binding?    How  about  the United           Nations or the giveaway of the Panama Canal?  This text is a channelling from a group who call themselves  Cosmic Awareness .

THE UNDERGROUND CITY AT DULCE, NEW MEXICO COSMIC AWARENESS is the Force that expressed Itself through Jesus of Nazareth, the Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Edgar Cayce and other great avatars who served as `Channels  for the `Heavenly Father  and who speaks again today as the world begins to enter the `New Age  of spiritual consciousness and awareness.  Since      Cosmic Awareness has been communicating through carefully trained channels.  This information is for those who desire to help in bringing in the New Age.  Throughout the thousands of `Readings  given through these various channels, Cosmic Awareness tells us not to believe anything, but to question, explore, doubt, and discover for yourself, through your own channel what is the truth.  Cosmic Awareness will only `indicate  and `suggest .  Neither C.A.C. or any of the Interpreters is responsible for anything Cosmic Awareness states in any of these readings, nor does C.A.C. or the Interpreters necessarily agree with the statements of Cosmic Awareness.  The Interpreters interpret the energies as they see them in trance levels and are not personally responsible for what is said.  The Interpreters published herein have no connection with, nor control over the editorial comments and material, including illustrations.  This is entirely the responsibility of the editor.  Members of C.A.C. are invited to send in questions of general interest to ask Awareness for possible publication in this newsletter.                                   Paul Shockley, Interpreter              ABOUT THE INFORMATION ON ALIENS THAT FOLLOWS                 Excerpts from a C.A.C. General Reading                               May   ,      Question:      This information on the alien presence, that has not yet been published:  Does Awareness suggest that this take priority over the other more spiritual information, because of the possibility that `window  could close sooner than expected, or does Awareness see this `window  remaining open and the alien information being sent out over a period of six months or a year and be balanced with other, less negative, information? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness suggests that the most poignant, most precise, most important information be released first; that the other information may be seen as likened unto the flesh that fills out the skeleton.      This Awareness indicates there could come a time wherein this information would be stopped.  There could be circumstances that would prevent the release of the information and this information, indeed, does need to be released.      There are many releasing information, but in proportion at this time, less than   percent of the population has any inkling of what is really going on, and at least   percent should know.  This Awareness indicates that probably one person in a thousand,  even fewer at this time,  has ever heard of the information released even by Cooper, or the elements involved in such information.  Probably only one in a thousand has ever heard of MJ   ...perhaps even fewer than one in a thousand.  It is likely that one in a half million, or quarter of a million, has heard of Nightmare Hall.  This Awareness indicates, of course, this is changing, and more and more are hearing of this.      This Awareness indicates that such information could be given to tabloids and immediately, upon publication, these figures would change enormously.  This Awareness indicates a recent tabloid did include information relating to Cooper and to Lazar, and much of the population became aware, but to a very limited degree, since the article was only approximately one half page in length.      This Awareness indicates that the important thing is that entities share the information with others who have some curiosity. Not to think that they can force C.A.C. to prove this information by bringing it to the authorities of their state or federal government or agencies, but to search for themselves, to see if this is accurate.  If you have questions or doubts about the accuracy of this information, go out and become a researcher for yourself.      Or, if you don t wish to do so, toss the paper into      the garbage can and forget it.  There are some entities      who seem to think that if they hear something that      offends them, they should turn it over to an authority      and make the authority check out the source to see if      it s true.      This Awareness indicates that It is giving you the sources, so that you can check them for yourself.  If you do not like the information, close your ears, cease your publication, stop your subscription, or don t bother to read it.  If you want to be aware, if you want knowledge, if you want truth, you have to be open to hearing even things you don t really like to hear.      This Awareness indicates that this information isn t for everyone; it is for the courageous, it is for the strong, it is for the daring, it is for those who dare to be aware.  This Awareness indicates that it is not the responsibility of C.A.C. to check the validity of all of this information, it is simply passing along information.  It is giving you the sources, so that you can check the validity.      This Awareness indicates that in checking the validity, you don t go to the people who are unaware, and you don t check on a whistle blower by going to the one who s had the whistle blown against them.  Thus, if Karen Silkwood blows the whistle on some nuclear plant, or group of people who are causing some environmental hazards, you don t go and ask those in charge of the creation of the hazards whether Karen Silkwood has her facts straight.  You don t ask the fox in the henhouse if it has seen a fox in the henhouse.      This Awareness indicates that unless entities understand the nature and purpose of this communication, to give them enough information that they may search further for themselves if they so desire   and there have been many over the years who have desired.   in fact, almost demanded,  information about UFO s.  If the information is given, and entities do not like the information, that is their problem.  They simply can ignore the information.  You do not have to attempt to rewrite the information.  If you do not like the story War of the Worlds, turn off your radio; don t expect to be able to rewrite the script.      This Awareness indicates that there are many who have demanded and requested for over a decade that this Awareness gives information relating to the UFO phenomenon.  Such information would have likely resulted in the death of the individuals herein present had It given information previously.  It is only recently that even the higher authorities have become aware of the activities of the aliens in regard to some of these atrocities, to the point where they have had enough dissension within their own ranks to debate whether to let the public know.  It is only recently that a few involved in the inner circles of knowers,  having knowledge about UFO s,  have had the courage to release information in spite of death threats, in spite of knowing that others have been killed for far less.      This Awareness indicates that with this reality, with this opportunity, this window that has suddenly opened, you who have received the information from these entities and comments on this from this Awareness, you are likened unto an elite, privileged few. The chances of having such information is so remote,  less than one in a million, or one in    million people at this time, know what you know.      This Awareness suggests you do not expect too much, and that you help in the dissemination of such information; but that you do it in a way that is appropriate.  This Awareness indicates that you not endanger yourself, that you now endanger others in the way you disseminate the information.                                                         THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY:          THE ALIEN PRESENCE  PART      THE UNDERGROUND CITY   PART    HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM BEING MONITORED OR ABDUCTED BY ALIENS                  C.A.C. General Reading, May   ,       QUESTION:               Awareness, we re here tonight for a general C.A.C. reading, with questions sent in by the membership.               Does Awareness have an opening message? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness suggests that entities may take precautions in regard to protecting themselves in the following manner.   This is in reference to those times in which an entity may feel the effect of a monitoring device, or that which appears to be a monitoring energy and they feel or hear in their ear, or feel around their head, which occurs from time to time with some entities; that in many cases, not all, but in many cases, this monitoring is done from alien technology .               How the Aliens Select Victims for Abduction      This Awareness indicates that one may ask:  How do the aliens select people whom they are to abduct?  This Awareness indicates that they select these entities from vibrations in the brainwave pattern that they seek for their particular interest or needs; that the selection of a particular type may vary from time to time and depending on what their purposes are, they may select a person at one time which they would have overlooked at a different time.      This Awareness indicates that it is possible to avoid those brainwave patterns that aliens would seek in their selection process by wrapping oneself in White Light.  This Awareness suggests that in the first place, the least likely person an alien would seek would be one whose brainwave pattern indicates a socially strong individualistic entity.  When you have a strong identification, knowing who in fact you really are, and have a strong connection with the spiritual essence of the highest, without much fear and without being easily swayed or easily influenced, you are less likely to become a candidate for abduction.      The more vulnerable and easily influenced you are, the more gullible you are, the more naive you are and the more distraught your thinking may be, the more you will tend to fit into the types of candidates that are usually abducted.  This Awareness indicates that having a strong will also is a negative for aliens in regard to abduction.  Also, aliens do not, if they are involved in wishing to use glandular substances or eat the entity, they do not like the effects of chocolate, coffee, cigarettes, or sugar or other types of addictive type foods and drugs in the system.  They prefer, this especially in regard to the reptilials; they prefer the more pure essences without toxins.  That this might be argued as a plus for these vices.      This Awareness indicates on the other hand, the use of drugs and alcohol can be the very thing that would distort a person s thinking to make them more likely to be a candidate for abduction, for other purposes.  The best protection one can have for oneself during the time of monitoring, because the monitoring process is designed to read these brain vibrations; the best protection is to wrap yourself in White Light, visualize the highest frequencies of Divinity coming down over you from the Divine Being Itself.      Thus, you can call on the High Self, call on the Christ, call on God, call on anything that you see as being the Highest and Best.  If you are in to Buddhism, call on Buddha.  If you are in to any of the other religions, call on the highest divinity that you can call on, and see this entity covering you with a shower of Light, wrapping you with Divine Light energy while this monitoring is in process.  It will sufficiently block the readings of the aliens if indeed they are the forces monitoring you.      This Awareness indicates that this is a psychological defense that you may use in regard to the psychoelectronic monitoring that aliens frequently do in their hunting process.  This Awareness indicates the term generally used is the `harvesting  process.  They see this action as a kind of harvesting.  Follow up Question :  Vikki      When I sensed that sound in my head, I automatically, almost like a reflex, repeated the Law of Love.  Does this afford protection, or should I change? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This can be beneficial.  It can help to say the Law of Love.  It is better to visualize the Light energy coming down over you.  If you can incorporate the two without losing the visionary image of the White Light coming down so that you re saying the Law of Love at the same time, you are clearly visualizing this love being showered over you, it can be even more effective.        AN ACCOUNT OF SEEING UFO S AND HEARING `CRICKED  SOUNDS QUESTION:      a sort of personal question from J.R., which is along this line. She writes:   The night I saw two saucer shaped crafts, just outside my bathroom window in West Virginia:  Whose craft were they and what were they doing in my yard?  Also, was it in response to the energy of my astonishment that they immediately took off?  Also, were they related to other craft seen in the area, the one written up in a local paper, the ones Dr. Jenkins said visited his family regularly; and currently:  why am I hearing the sound of crickets whenever it is quiet enough to hear it?  Is this an effect of meditation, stress, UFO s or physiological malfunction?       COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that It suggests that you be most attentive and cautious; that these entities were not Pleiadians; that the Pleiadians essentially have abandoned this planet temporarily and may not be able to return.  There are some entities from Sirius who are benevolent beings.  These were not the entities from Sirius either.  There are some humans in saucers from the technology that has been acquired from the alliance with the Greys; that the Greys in some cases are not as vicious or hostile as others.  In regard to the entities whom you saw, it appears that these were humans of your government testing craft in the general area without a desire to be noticed; that they did not recognize your presence when first landing in the area.                  How the `Good  UFO Will Contact You This Awareness indicates that it is very important however, to avoid any contact with those of UFO s unless you are absolutely sure that these are Pleiadians or from Sirius, and these entities will often give you ways by which you can be absolutely sure.  This Awareness indicates they will make themselves gradually known over a period of time before contacting anyone in a close encounter.      This Awareness indicates that they tend to set up appointments telepathically, letting you know that they will be there at a certain time, where to look, where to expect them.  Anything other than this kind of appointment should be considered suspect of the more malevolent type aliens; that the aliens will be tending, and have tended to become more bold in their abductions and this may increase as they are increasing in number.  This Awareness indicates the increase of approximately   ,    per month in recent months has been a kind of average influx during the three days of the full moon.                  Look for Holes or Marks on Your Body      This Awareness indicates that these entities generally going to the bases which then allow them to traverse underground to other places in other areas through these underground tunnels.  Anyone who has seen a UFO should also double check their memory, trying to recall if there were any marks on their body or energy weaknesses shortly thereafter, for in many cases, an entity will see a UFO, be abducted for a certain length of time, usually on the average of two hours, anywhere from twenty minutes to two hours, then released, and the entity will not remember having been abducted, but will simply remember having seen the UFOs or whatever took place prior to the abduction.      This Awareness indicates that if, in examining oneself one finds holes, such as in the back of the ear, or chin, or a pain in the nose, or in the back of the head, or somewhere else on the body or in the naval area or the genitalia area, there is good reason to suspect that an abduction and experimentation or implanting has taken place. This Awareness indicates that generally, the memory is gone, but the subconscious effects and feeling of violation will endure and cause severe problems thereafter.      Most entities having been abducted benefit only from therapy that is similar to that of rape cases.  The action being very much like that of rape, in which an entity has been violated against his or her will, and the feeling of having been violated can create severe hostility and make one feel one is violated and a victim, affecting many of the entity s relationships and activities thereafter.  It is important for entities to get help when such an event is realized.      This Awareness suggests however, that it is equally important that entities not fake an abduction just for attention, because such action can cause you other kinds of problems that you may not really desire.  It may be that, for example, you find yourself at some future time being looked at as an abductee when in fact you aren t, and in some ways, you may feel you have classified yourself into a certain category that you no longer want to wear as a label.  This Awareness indicates that it is not something that entities should fake for attention or as a means of self importance; that generally speaking, entities could not fake the action anyway and will be embarrassed and found out when in deeper therapy. FOLLOW UP QUESTION:      Is there any significance to the cricket sound she s been hearing? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is not seen clearly.  This Awareness suggests the entity may wish to pursue further investigation in this regard to determine whether this might be the result of an implant which the entity does not recall receiving.  It also could be the result of the close proximity of the craft and vibration and radiation given off from the craft which may be affecting her.  The energy is not seen as to why this is occurring, if it still is occurring for the entity.      This Awareness indicates the entity may wish to read THE GULF BREEZE SIGHTINGS in which this writer tells about an attempt by the aliens to abduct him, wherein thereafter he always heard a sound, vibration in his head, or a hum, when the craft came anywhere near, even though others could not hear that humming sound.  This Awareness indicates that approximately one in thirty five or one in forty entities have been abducted or have in some way received implants; that not all implants have been effected in the craft.               How the Aliens Enter a Bedroom to Implant                 Who are the Candidates for Implants?       These aliens have the ability, in wearing certain types of packs on their backs, to move through walls or through rooftops, to come right into one s home, even into one s bedroom, while an entity sleeps, and to give an implant.  This is very rare that this occurs however, and in most cases, the implants have been given to entities who have worked in and around government operated bases or alien operated bases, or people who work in government occupations, in order that the aliens have some control over these entities.  That these are the more likely candidates for implants.  It is not seen as a likelihood that persons operating in more socially oriented occupations, even if in government, such as the post office, or the revenue department, or commerce department, that these would be special candidates for implants, but more toward the types who would work in military occupations, secret bases, or projects, or entities working in corporations that have close contact with this type of operation, or the families of such entities, the close working families, and also people who live near or around those places where UFO government operations may be visible to the population.      Thus, for example, the city or town of Dulce, New Mexico, as being one in which many of the local people have been implanted and abducted.         THAT DEVICE THE ALIENS PACK  HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK?                    THAT FORCE THAT RESIDES IN SPACE   FOLLOW UP QUESTION :      That device the aliens pack with them that enables them to get into a home:  does this device enable them to raise their own vibrational rate so they can enter matter, or does it raise the vibration of the matter and allow them to enter, or just how does it work? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates it creates a field around the entity which makes the matter lose its density.  It is as though matter is created by atoms in molecular structure, held together by a spatial force.  If you were to look at matter with a high enough microscope you would see there is more space than substance, yet there is a force surrounding these particles that tends to bind them together, holding them in place so that even though they are scattered apart with great space between them, this would be equivalent, for example, to a small ball on a football field, the substance of equating to the space, and the actual substance of the atom being the size of a football; that is the way atoms would appear if viewed with a powerful enough microscope, and the question may be:  `How can these things be held together?       It is that force that resides in the space and not the matter that holds things together, and the aliens  pack is able to overcome that force, is able to defuse that force, so that the atoms of the body and the atoms of the wall actually pass through each other, just as if there were no force between the spaces.  It is likened unto sand going through a screen.  If the sand is small enough and the screen s holes are large enough, the sand can pass through, but if that sand is made into a ball held together by blue, and it is placed on a screen, it can t pass through, especially if the glue has been spread on the screen.  The glue is the force that resides between the particles that make up the atom.      This Awareness indicates the aliens have the technology to leave the particles intact, but to diminish the glue that holds the objects as solid, and this is done through the use of vibration, the raising of certain vibrations just high enough to overcome that frequency of the force, the glue force.                THE TRILATERAL INSIGNIA:  AN ALIEN FLAG QUESTION:     A question by M.G. in New York:   The alien flag Trilateral insignia referred to by Cooper, is this the start of the Trilateral group of humans and aliens? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This  Awareness indicates that the Trilateral humans took their name from the Trilateral Insignia of the aliens.  The symbols are different.                    THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY:   PART          ALL ABOUT THAT ALIEN UNDERGROUND BASE AT DULCE, NEW MEXICO QUESTION:      There s some questions that arise from a book called:  ALIEN MAGIC, by William F. Hamilton III, and there s a part of this book called:  THE DULCE BASE,  by Jason Bishop the third, and I d like to read some of this, if it s alright, and ask Awareness to confirm or deny this information, and when appropriate, to expand on it.*               *ALIEN MAGIC, by William F. Hamilton III,               published by UFORCES,     N. Brand Blvd.,               Suite    , Glendale, Calif.       COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this in the affirmative, that It may from time to time raise the hand of the Interpreter to signal a pause for comment.      QUESTIONER:   Begins reading :       The following material comes from people who know the underground base at Dulce, New Mexico, exists.  They are people who worked in the labs, abductees taken to the base; people who assisted in the construction; Intelligence personnel  CIA, NSA, etc.  and UFO and Inner Earth researchers.  This information is meant for those who are seriously interested in the Dulce Base.  For your own protection, be advised to `USE CAUTION  while investigating this complex.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness suggests not only that entities, particularly in your organization, use caution, but that they NOT investigate this complex; that it is too well guarded; that only those who have clearance will be allowed in, and for entities not to think that they can simply run down there and explore the area.  This Awareness mentions this because there are all types of people in your membership and some tend to be quite naive, and often want to express an unusual sense of adventure based on that naivete.      This Awareness indicates that entities so inclined might not return, and might end up being part of the experimentation conducted at the base. READING CONTINUES:       This facility is a `GENETICS LAB  and is connected to Los Alamos, via a Tube Shuttle  underground .  Part of their research is related to the Genetic Effects of Radiation  Mutations and Human Genetics .  Research there also includes other `Intelligent Species   Alien biological Life Forms `Entities  .      In the revised Sept.       edition of THE EFFECTS OF ATOMIC WEAPONS, prepared for and in cooperation with the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, under the direction of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, we read about how  complete underground placement of bases is desirable.   On page    :   There are apparently no fundamental difficulties in construction and operating underground various types of important facilities.  Such facilities must be placed in a suitable existing mine or a site may be excavated for the purpose.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this as accurate; that this kind of underground networking has gone on, not only during this previous century from the time of World War II as mentioned, but that there are and have been other underground caverns created by the aliens many hundreds and thousands of years prior to this time, and these have been used along with the present excavations and mining activities of government and alien technologies.  This Awareness reminds you of readings given some ten years ago regarding the subterranean caverns; that many of these were man made caverns, and some were natural, but had been modified by machines of the more advanced technologies of the subterranean aliens.*                 *`Revelations of Awareness  No.      :                        The Secret of the UFOs .      This Awareness indicates the Deros described during that time are remnants of a humanoid species that were left underground for many generations.  They have continued in their underground civilization which, through a network of caverns and tunnels extends throughout the United States, South America and in through Europe and other regions.  These tunnels have been known by the Illuminati, which was formed in      on May  st, by Adam Weishaupt, which is the reason for the May  st celebration in many countries; that this Illuminati as the foundation for many of the occult and conspiracy type organizations that have followed.  It was based on the alien contact by these entities.      This Awareness indicates, of course, there were still earlier contacts with aliens on this planet, these contacts researching back into prehistory.  This Awareness suggests the questions continue.  READING CONTINUES :       Centuries ago, Surface People  some say the Illuminati  entered into a pact with an  Alien Nation   hidden within the Earth .  The U.S. government, in     , agreed to trade animals and humans in exchange for High Tech knowledge, and to allow them to use  undisturbed  underground bases, in the Western USA.  A Special Group was formed to deal with the Alien Beings.  In the      s `Alien Life Forms   ALF  began shifting their focus of operations, from Central and South America, to the USA.  The Continental Divide is vital to these `Entities .  Part of this has to do with Magnetics  Substrata Rock  and high Energy States  Plasma .  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This is in the affirmative.  This Awareness indicates that this shift into this area was partly due to the use of the atomic bomb in its infancy; the first atomic bomb being exploded in Alamogordo. That this drew great attention from the aliens and in realizing that these aliens use underground caverns, one can understand why they became quite concerned with atomic bombs blowing holes in the earth, and would like to have some input on the government using such weapons.  READING CONTINUES :       Whose Planet is This?  These Aliens consider themselves `Native Terrans  .  They are an ancient race  descendant from a Reptilian Humanoid Species which cross bred with Sapient Humans . COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is in reference, not to all types of Greys, but to some of the Greys; the Greys from Orion in particular; that there are also other variations which do not have much of the reptilian genetics in them, but have some insect base. This Awareness indicates that the Greys who were present after World War II, who were present in this pact with the U.S. government, and the Greys who were present...This Awareness indicates there were Greys present on this planet in contact with humans in the late Twenties and early Thirties, but there were also other tall Greys that came to this planet in the period of approximately        ; these being from Orion.      The Zeta Reticuli Greys, coming in contact more in the Sixties; that the earlier Greys as having already been in the area, and the pact which led to the underground cavern bases was with these and also with the tall Orion Greys.  Later, the Zeta Reticuli were brought in to certain agreements and allowed to have bases and there were further arrangements with them.  They are all interrelated in some ways as different species, in a similar manner that on earth different races might still work together, though be somewhat segregated and somewhat different from each other.  READING CONTINUES :       They are untrustworthy manipulator/mercenary agents for another extraterrestrial culture  the Draco , who are returning to earth  their ancient `outpost   to use it as a staging area.      But, these alien cultures are in conflict over whose agenda will be followed for this planet.  All the while mental control is being used to keep humans `in place,  especially since the Forties.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative; that there is the conflict and agreement between the Grey Reticuli and the Reptilians; that of the Grey Reticuli, the orange group as being the more hostile to the Reptilians; that it is also the more hostile group in regard to Grey/human relationships.  This Awareness indicates, however, that it does offer a potential for shifting of alliances between the Greys and the humans, since the orange Grey group is quite hostile to the Reptilians, it offers the humans an important opportunity to align themselves with the Greys and a potential for the alliance to be used in case of a conflict with the Reptilians.      This Awareness indicates that it would appear that there is the potential of a situation occurring on this planet in which if the Reptilians arrive, the human race would not survive for any meaningful length of time in any quality of life.  It would, it appears, deteriorate in such a manner that the human race would simply become useful as food for the Reptilians; this in the event sufficient numbers of Reptilians came and were able to control the masses of humans, and through their present allies, the Greys, it would appear this would be possible.  Without the alliance between the Greys and the humans, it would appear that the Reptilians would have very little obstruction to their total dominion of the planet.      This Awareness indicates there is still the element of the Pleiadians and the entities from Sirius, as a potential, but that this is not at present seen as being a great potential, since especially the Pleiadians are in deep trouble at home.  READING CONTINUES :       The DULCE Complex is joint U.S. Government/Alien base.  It was NOT the first built with the aliens.   Others are in Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, etc.   Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This is in the affirmative.  READING CONTINUES :       The Secret Activity .  Paul Benewitz reports, about his study into the Dulce area:   Troops went in and out of there every summer, starting in     .  The natives do recall that.  They also built a road  right in front of the people of Dulce, and trucks went in and out for a long period.  That road was later blocked and destroyed. The signs on the trucks were  Smith Corporation  out of Pagosa Springs, Colorado.  No such corporation exists now...no records exist...I believe the Base, at least the first one, was being built then undercover of a lumbering project.  The problem:  they never hauled logs.  Only BIG equipment.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative; that there also was built an underground tunnel from the area of Alamogordo to the base.  READING CONTINUES :       R & R and the Military Industrial Complex.  The Rand Corporation became involved and did a study for the Base.  Most of the lakes near Dulce were made `for  the Indians, via government grants.  Navajo Dam is the main source for conventional electric power, with a second source in El Vado  also an entrance .      Note:  If Rand Corp. is the mother of `Think Tanks , then the Ford Foundation must be considered the father.  Rand secrecy is not confirmed to `reports,  but on occasion extends to conferences and meetings.  On page number     of the PROJECT RAND: Proceedings of the Deep Underground Construction Symposium  March,       we read:       Just as airplanes, ships and automobiles have given man mastery of the surface of the Earth, tunnel Boring Machines...will give him access to the subterranean World.       Note:  The Sept.      issue of Omni magazine  Page     has a color drawing of  The SUBTERRENE , the Los Alamos nuclear powered tunnel machine that burrows through the rock, deep underground, by heating whatever stone it encounters into molten rock  magma , which cools after the Subterrene has moved on.  The result is a tunnel with a smooth, glazed lining.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this, using atomic energy in the process of heating these rocks, not only melts the rocks to allow for the tunneling to take place, but it reduces the magma of these melted rocks in terms of size so that there is very little or no residue which needs to be carried out of the tunnel, so that the hole itself is simply plastered up against the sides of the tunnel in a kind of melted shell.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :      That would account for the absence of great piles of dirt and rocks in that area, wouldn t it? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This is in the affirmative.  CONTINUING WITH THE STATEMENT :       These underground tubes are used by electromagnetically powered  Subshuttle Vehicles,  which can travel at great speeds.  They connect the `Hidden Empire  Sub City complexes.  Also, the top secret project code named  Noah s Ark,  uses `Tube Shuttles  in connection with a system of over     `Bunkers  and `Bolt Holes  which have been established at various places on Earth.  With other bases inside the Moon and Mars.  Many of these underground cities are complete with streets, sidewalks, lakes, small electric cars, apartments, offices and shopping malls.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative.  This Awareness reminds you that there have been numerous movies that have covered many of the things that are now being exposed as realities. You will recall the movie in which the entity had his ear down to the sidewalk, hearing tunnels or hearing a machine underground, boring the earth, boring a tunnel, and everyone thought the entity was insane.  This Awareness indicates that there have been numerous efforts by some entities to leak information, in some ways to alert the public of these various things.      This Awareness indicates that most of the information went into movies that were seen as fantasy, and entities were entertained rather than informed, but now that entities are becoming informed and looking back on the entertainment that has been given during the past several decades, these movies will begin to take on a new meaning. This Awareness indicates JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, as well as many of the movies regarding duplicates and clones now have new meaning.  Also, that in looking back on the earlier Awareness readings in which It spoke of synthetics and robotoids, entities will see that these too take on a new meaning.  This Awareness suggests the questions continue.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       I had one question about the shopping malls.  Are these designed for humans that are working underground there, or are these used by aliens? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this as mostly for humans, but that there also are some shopping places for aliens too; that some instances of human/alien intermingling is present underground, but in most cases, in the higher levels, it is more a human type of society, although in some cases, the more benevolent aliens will also be found in certain areas, intermingling with humans, even in those levels. That in the deeper levels, the aliens have greater domination.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       This tunnel machine mentioned that uses atomic energy and burrows, melting the rock; was this technology given to the United States by the aliens, or did the United States develop that itself?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that it is an alien machine.  This has been used down through centuries.  It has been modified, but the concept and the initial construction as that which is alien.  The more recent development as being a joint construction for and by humans and aliens in cooperation.  There are more than one such machine.  This Awareness indicates that these machines however, use technology that were of alien origin, along with other aspects that can be understood by human engineers.  READING CONTINUES :       There were over     attendees to the      RAND Symposium.  Most were representatives of the Corporate Industrial State, like:  The General Electric Company; AT & T; Hughes Aircraft; Northrop Corp.; Sandia Corp.; Stanford Research Institute; Walsh Construction Company; The Bechtel Corporation; Colorado School of Mines; etc.      Bechtel  pronounced Beck tull  in a supersecret international corporate octopus, founded in     .  Some say the firm is really a  SHADOW GOVERNMENT   a working arm of the CIA.  It is the largest construction and engineering outfit in the USA and the world,  and some say, beyond .      The most important posts in the U.S. government are held by former Bechtel officers.  They are part of  THE WEB   an interconnected control system  which links the Tri Lateralist plans, the CFR, the Orders of `Illuminism   Cult of the All Seeing Eye  and other interlocking groups.       Is that information correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative; that you will recall, especially during the Reagan administration, the scandals associated with many of his cronies, and the connections with Bechtel; that in reviewing these, you will find the above information being pertinent.  READING CONTINUES :       The Dulce Facility consists of a central `Hub,  the Security Section,  also some photo labs .  The deeper you go, the stronger the Security.  This is a multi leveled Complex.  There are over      cameras at various high security locations  Exits and Labs .  There are over     Secret Exits near and around Dulce.  Many around Archuleta Mesa, others to the south around Dulce Lake and even as far east as Lindrith.       Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This is in the affirmative.  This Awareness indicates that there are caves used by aliens throughout the United States, Canada and South America, as well as in Europe.  Many of these are small bases inside mountains that are in more remote areas; that there are underground tunnels connecting many of these.  In some cases, the openings are used for the spacecraft for entrance and exits in isolated bases, but in most cases, the bases are connected by underground tunnels.  These extend also into Washington, Oregon, Canada, the Aleutian Islands, into Russia, and into most other countries, especially in the Northern hemisphere of Europe; a;so in Australia and New Zealand.  There are older bases in South America, in Brazil, in Central America, and in the areas of Chile, Venezuela, and Peru.  READING CONTINUES :       Deep sections of the Complex connect into natural cavern systems.  A person who worked at the Base, who had an `ULTRA  ` clearance, reports:   There may be more than seven Levels, but I only know of seven.  Most of the aliens are on levels  ,  , and  .  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates there ten levels; that the three lower levels have to do with the construction of technological instruments and craft.  READING CONTINUES :       ...Alien housing is lever  .   Is this correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This as in the affirmative; this as the level where the aliens live and interact together in their time when they are not involved in their activities of industry.  READING CONTINUES :       We are leaving the era of expendable resources, like oil based products.  The power of the future is re newable resources...  Biologically Engineered.   The Dulce Genetic Research was originally funded under the cloak of  Black Budget  Secrecy.   Billions of dollars.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This is where the drugs and drug money has been flowing to. This Awareness indicates that this as also having received much funding from the NSA hidden agenda and purposes; that much of the enormous tax assessment on the nation and the great debt that has accumulated over the years is due to this funding.  READING CONTINUES :       They were interested in intelligent  Disposable Biology   Humanoids , to do the dangerous atomic  Plutonium  rocket and saucer experiments.       We cloned  our  own little Humanoids, via a process perfected in the Bio Genetic Research Center of the World, Los Alamos! COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this relates to the synthetics and in Russia, to the robotoids; that the reading continue.  READING CONTINUES :       Now, we have our own `disposable  slave race.  Like the alien `Greys   EBES , the U.S. government clandestinely impregnated females, then removed the hybrid fetus,  after about   months  and then accelerated their growth in the Lab.  Biogenetic  DNA Manipulation  programming is instilled; they are `implanted  and controlled at a distance through regular RF  Radio Frequency  transmissions.  These act as telepathic  Channels  and telemetric brain  Advanced Research Project Agency .  Two of the procedures were R.H.I.C.  Radio Hypnotic Intracerebral Memory .  The brain transceiver is inserted into the head through the nose.  These devices are used in the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as in Sweden.  The Swedish Prime Minister Palme gave the National Swedish Police Board the right, in     , to insert brain transmitters into the heads of human beings covertly.      They also developed ELF and E.M. wave propagation equipment  RAYS , which can affect the nerves and can cause nausea, fatigue, irritability, even death.  This is essentially the same as Richard Shaver s Cavern  Telaug  Mech.  This research into biodynamic relationships within organisms   Biological Plasma   has produced a RAY that can change the  genetic structure  and  HEAL  also.       Is that information correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:                   How Dr. Beter Got His Information               This Awareness indicates that this is correct; that the instruments which Dr. Beter once spoke of in his Audio Letters as being able to locate and determine what anyone on earth was doing at any time, is an instrument that was just spoken of, that was made available through his contacts with scientists in Nevada; that they were using these instruments in order to supply him with information for his Audio Letters.  You will recall that often he spoke of entities who would allegedly be at some place, but by his sources would be found to be elsewhere, such as Jim Jones actually being flown to Israel and being thrown out of a plane near the Turkish boarder, and other instances of a similar nature, wherein entities were believed by press releases and so forth to be in a certain place, and Dr. Beter would indicate that they were truly elsewhere.      This Awareness indicates that this also allowed them to distinguish between the real entity and a duplicate, a double who was replacing that entity, because the vibration of that double would be slightly altered and different.  This Awareness indicates that Dr. Beter also was able to distinguish the difference between a robotoid, synthetic and human, because the human had a soul at the time; that in his later reports and in further technology, the robotoids were even being given a soul.      This Awareness indicates that this occurred through further alien technology in which the soul of an entity can be severed from the body and implanted into another s body.  It is a technology that allows for the Walk In.  It also allows for the soul to be put into a duplicate body, a robotoid for example, so that the soul can continue to exist after the first body has been eliminated, and in this kind of action it is almost the same as if the entity had received a new body.  That in this sense, and for the purposes of changing the entity from one body to another, the reason for such might be, for example, to alter the memory or alter the philosophy of an entity in moving it from one body to another, by erasing certain aspects of memory.      This Awareness indicates you will recall that the memory is stored in the etheric, between the mental and etheric bodies, and that it can be altered in the human.  It can also be erased, and by taking the soul and these bodies from one physical body and putting them into another replica of the physical body, they can actually bring about a changed person with a different philosophy or different values, and yet the entity would essentially be the same personality. This Awareness indicates that perhaps this can answer many questions that entities have had, in regard to past notable figures that have been indicated by Dr. Beter as having been replaced by duplicate bodies.  This Awareness suggests the reading continue.  READING CONTINUES :       Warning:  Manipulation and Control, Fear and Favor...The Pentagon, the CIA, NSA, FBI,DEA, NSC, etc. seek to capitalize on the beliefs of the American public.  The Secret Government is getting ready to `stage  a contact landing with Aliens in the near future. This way they can `Control  the release of Alien related propaganda. We will be told of an inter stellar conflict.  But...what looks real, may be FAKE.  What is disinformation?  Is your attention being diverted by the strategy of a `Shadow Plan ?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this refers to the scenario described in Stan Deyo s book, THE COSMIC CONSPIRACY, as that which would be a staged version, using the beliefs of the American people in regard to the BOOK OF REVELATION, wherein entities would be expecting the return of Christ after some kind of event or situation that might lead to a kind of Armageddon.  This Awareness indicates that the only thing about this is that there is, in fact the threat of the Reptilian invasion; these entities coming in a planetoid which does not travel at above light speed; this because of such great number of entities, in needing a planetoid for the transference of the population.      This Awareness indicates that if the so called invasion occurs before     , and especially if it occurs around     , entities can probably be correct in assuming it is staged.  It may be staged to set up the atmosphere for a One World Government.  If it is held off until approximately      or `   or thereafter, then entities can presume it is probably for real, as by that time the Reptilians would have made their approach, would be close enough to pose a real threat.  READING CONTINUES :       Berkeley, Los Alamos Labs Chosen to Explore Makeup of Human Genome.   Overt and Covert Research .  As U.S. Energy Secretary, John Harrington, named the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and New Mexico s Los Alamos National Laboratory to house new advanced genetic research centers as part of a project to decipher the human genome.  The genome holds the genetically coded instructions that guide the transformation of a single cell  a fertilized egg  into a Biological Being.   The Human Genome Project may well have the greatest direct impact on a humanity of any scientific initiative before us today,  said David Shirley, Director of the Berkeley Laboratory.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is the exploration of the genes and all of the codes that go into creating the various lifeforms based on the patterns involved in the code of the molecular structures that make up the genes.  This Awareness indicates that there has been some research; that approximately   % of this genetic coding has been researched by your universities, and the research being classified in such a way as to allow them to splice, remove, delete, add to that genetic code in order to create changes in the code, that it can be used for destroying or creating diseases, destroying or creating lifeforms, destroying or creating plants, animals or whatever that may be tampered with genetically.      This Awareness indicates that it can also be used to modify any of these things; thus, it has the potential for altering all forms of life, for good or ill, and for creating all types of life in different forms.  This Awareness indicates that the effort is to may out and decode all of the DNA, and in so doing, have complete control over the lifeforms and the creation, modification or destruction for these forms.  It is through this information that many of the creatures described on Level   in Nightmare Hall, such as the many  legged human, were created genetically.           Atlantean Genetics:  The Creation of the  Things       This awareness indicates that you will recall the Edgar Cayce readings, in the readings on Atlantis, in which he described the  Things  which the Atlanteans created.  These were grossly distorted creatures; that the `Things  that were created became a part of society.  These were also entities who were the product of alien technology in the time of Atlantis.  This Awareness indicates that these creations were also grotesque and of those things which are common to humans today;  the cat and the pig were direct creations of Atlantean genetics.      This Awareness indicates that the pig having some human genes intermixed with earlier wild boar.  The cat, being created from genes that had belonged to the Greys.  You will notice the cat like eyes of the Greys; these were incorporated into the genes used for creating the cat.  This also is a reason why there were cat societies, societies that worshipped the cat, thinking they were a kind of reflection of the gods of the time, many entities seeing these Grey aliens as gods.      This Awareness suggests the reading continue.           WHY PORK IS CONSIDERED  UNCLEAN MEAT  BY THE JEWS  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       I was wondering if these human genes in the pig could possibly be connected to the ancient Jewish philosophy that pork is unclean meat and should not be eaten?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this as in the affirmative; that there is also the concern about the cloven hoof; that entities were permitted to eat food of a certain type, but not from those animals having a cloven hoof.  The cloven hoof also has been associated with the devil.  This Awareness reminds you also that the Grey aliens have two toes.  This Awareness indicates that the entities cloning the Hebrews were of a type that were what you might call enemies of the Greys, and did not want their clones fraternizing with or being associated with the Greys or anything that had connection with them, also did not want them eating food that had human genes in it, such as the pig.                                                                         THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY:   PART   ... NIGHTMARE HALL   READING CONTINUES :      This overlaps some information just given by Awareness.       Covertly, this research has been going on for years at Dulce Labs.  Level No.   is privately called  Nightmare Hall,  it holds the Genetic Labs.  Reports from workers who have seen bizarre experimentation are as follows:       I have seen multi legged `humans  that look like half human/half octopus.  Also Reptilian humans, and furry creatures that have hands like humans and cries like a baby; it mimics human words...also huge mixtures of Lizard humans in cages.   There are fish, seals, birds and mice that can barely be considered those species.  There are several cages  and vats  of Winged humanoids, grotesque bat like creatures, but    /  to   feet tall.  Gargoyle  like beings and Draco Reptoids.       Is that information true? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this scratches the surface.  There are far more grotesque creatures than were described.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :      Isn t that the very thing that brought down Atlantis? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This as in the affirmative.  READING CONTINUES :       Level   is worse:  row after row of thousands of humans and human mixtures in cold storage.  Here too are embryo storage vats of Humanoids, in various stages of development.       I frequently encountered humans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and begged for help.  We were told they were hopelessly insane, and involved in high risk tests to cure insanity.       We were told to never try to speak to them at all.  At the beginning we believed that story.  Finally, in     , a small group of workers discovered the truth.  It began the `Dulce Wars,   and a secret resistance Unit was formed .       Note:  There are over   ,    `Aliens  at the Dulce Base. COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates there are closer to    ,    aliens at this time; that approximately    ,    in the Dulce base, and    ,    more that have moved through the base to other bases; these continuing to enter at a rate of about   ,    per month.  This Awareness indicates the base at Ada, Oklahoma, as still being active; this being approached from underground; that the recent floods in that area as having been in part deliberately allowed to help slow and hinder activities at the base.      This Awareness indicates that the government as being divided; that one faction wishes to stop the aliens from further growth and the other faction wishing to work with the aliens, collaborating with them.  The aliens wishing to move their entire population from their dying planet to this one as quickly as possible, even prior to the arrival of the Draco Reptilians.   This Awareness suggests the reading continue .  READING CONTINUES :       In late     , there was a confrontation  over weapons , a lot of scientists and military personnel were killed.  The base was closed for a while...but, it is currently active.      Note: Human and animal abductions  for their blood and other parts  slowed in the mid     s, when the Livermore Berkeley labs began production of artificial blood for Dulce.      William Cooper states:   A clash occurred wherein    of our people, from the National Recon Group, the DELTA group, which is responsible for security of all alien connected projects, were killed. COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this occurred in more places than the Dulce base; that in many other areas there were raids by humans into these alien bases, and skirmishes and activities in which many of these aliens were killed, or their bases shut down.  This Awareness indicates that even here in your  own state of Washington, and also in Oregon, this type of thing occurred; that it was in connection with a group working through the CIA, and that this did begin to have some effect.      This Awareness indicates, however, that there was also a split in the intelligence bureaus, it appears came from MJ   , in which there was one faction that wanted this conflict to stop immediately, and collaboration to continue; and because of this in fighting within the agency, many of those agents who were working to hinder the aliens, resulted in their being covertly eliminated, especially those who had special skills in this area of raiding these caves.  READING CONTINUES :       The DELTA Group  Within the Intelligence Support Activity  have been seen with badges which have a black triangle on a red background.   DELTA is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet .  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative; that these entities are often witnessed as the group using black helicopters; that the movie versions of the Delta Force, as that which was based on rumors that such a force existed; these being particularly related to UFO and alien concerns and not to raid into other countries as a kind of SWAT team organization; this not being their purpose, as depicted in movies.  READING CONTINUES :       It has the form of a triangle, and figures prominently in certain Masonic signs.  Each base has its own symbol.  The Dulce base symbol is a triangle with the Greek letter  Tau  `T  within it, and then the symbol is inverted, so the triangle points down.  The insignia of `a triangle and   lateral lines  has been seen on `Saucer  transport  Craft,   the Tri lateral symbol.  Other symbols mark landing sites and Alien craft.      And they draw some of the symbols here that look like Indian teepees and so forth.  Is this information correct? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is the affirmative; that these symbols appear to be correct in regard to the connection described. This Awareness indicates that the Greek symbols relate back to symbols from Akkadia, and even back to symbols of Sumeria, and these were given as symbols of Sumeria, and these were given as symbols from the aliens of that time; thus the symbols are a kind of link between alien and modern human language, neither quite alien, nor neither quite English, but of a language that many who have been educated in your modern schools can easily find and adjust to in using the Greek symbols.      The aliens also then have the capacity of adjusting their language or symbolic writings into Greek, which is not too difficult for them, and the humans to use as a mediating written language, in terms of symbols.  READING CONTINUES :       Inside the Dulce Base, Security officers wear jump suits, with the Dulce symbol on the front upper left side.  The standards hand  weapon at Dulce, is a `Flash gun,  which is good against humans and aliens.  The I.D. card  used in card slots for the doors and elevators  has the Dulce symbol above the I.D. photo.   Government Honchos  use cards with the Great Seal of the U.S. on it.   The Cult of the All Seeing Eye   The New World Order ...  ,        the Phoenix Empire...   ... Illuminism, ...`One out of many.   COSMIC AWARENESS:                       How the Flash Gun Operates      This Awareness indicates that this as in the affirmative; that in regard to the flash gun; that this as being likened unto a kind of laser ray gun; that it is a real life version of the Star Trek phaser; the difference being that the flash gun works in such a way that the entity doesn t simply die from the blast, but is dried up. This Awareness indicates that there is the potential for setting the flash gun to different frequencies or different ranges of temperature; that its most intense range as that which immediately dissolves or evaporates all water in the body, causing a body to shrivel up totally, so that nothing in the sense of liquid within the body is present.      Thus, the entity literally burns up at whatever speed is appropriate according to the setting of the flash gun; very quickly or very slowly.  It is essentially a death ray that works on the water in the body.  READING CONTINUES :       After the second level, everyone is weighed, in the nude, then given a uniform.  `Visitors  are given an `off white  uniform.  In front of ALL sensitive areas are scales built under the doorway, by the door control.  The person s care must match with the weight and code or the door won t open.  Any discrepancy in weight  any change over three pounds  will summon Security.  No one is allowed to carry anything into or out of sensitive areas.  All supplies are put thru a Security conveyer system.  The alien symbol language appears alot at the facility.      During the construction of the Facility  which was done in stages, over many years , the aliens assisted in the design and construction materials.  Many of the things assembled by the workers were of a technology they could not understand, yet...it would function when fully put together.  Example:  The elevators have no cables.  They are controlled magnetically.  The magnetic system is inside the walls.      There are no conventional electrical controls.  All is controlled by advanced magnetics.  That includes a magnetically induced  phosphorescent  illumination system.  There are no regular light bulbs.  All exits are magnetically controlled.  Note:  It has been reported that,  if you place a large magnet on an entrance, it will affect an immediate interruption.  They will have to come and reset the system.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative; that there is a totally different advancement in terms of technology used by these entities in regard to an advancement that worked from the base of electro magnetics without the use of wires, whereas your technology transferred electricity through wires and created a system along different lines.  There was less mechanical activity in their technology, and more electronic and magnetic technology, and more electronic and magnetic technology development.      This Awareness indicates the lighting system used as that which is painted upon the walls, or placed on the walls in a kind of paint which is affected by an electromagnetic charge that is applied, which causes the wall to light,   this affecting the paint on the walls and the substances that are in that painted material.  QUESTIONER :      The Interpreter s been in trance for quite a while, and we would like to bring him up at this time and continue this reading later, if it is alright with Awareness. COSMIC AWARENESS:      This as in the affirmative.  This Awareness suggests that this may be seen as a break; that the questions may continue after a brief interruption from our sponsor.  The Law of Gratitude is given                                                              THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY:   PART   ...THE DARK SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY  READING CONTINUES...after dinner :       The town of Dulce.  The area around Dulce has had a high number of reported animal mutilations.  The government and the aliens used the animals for environmental tests, psychological warfare on people, etc.  The aliens also wanted large amounts of blood for Genetic, Nutritional and other reasons.       In the book, ET s and UFOs  They Need Us, We Don t Need Them, by Virgil `Posty  Armstrong, he reports how his friends  Bob and Sharon  stopped for the night in Dulce and went out to dinner.   They overheard some local residents openly and vociferously discussing extra terrestrial abduction of townspeople for purposes of experimentation.   The ET s had our government s knowledge and approval.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative; that in any of those areas near those bases there is an excessive degree of danger of abduction or otherwise intimidation.  That in regard to the aliens  need for large amounts of blood, there is recently a scientific breakthrough in regard to the use of cattle blood being altered to work for human transfusions; that the use of cattle blood in humans is a possibility on a one time basis, without such alteration.  With the alteration, it can be repeatedly used without side effects; that within approximately   years there will be no need for a blood transfusion from the use of human blood.      This Awareness indicates that part of this is a side effect from the experimentation that involves alien technology and the cattle and human mutilations and the researches into the different types of blood.  This Awareness indicates that much of the blood supplied to the aliens could be supplied from slaughterhouses, were this to be more organized, and this would help to prevent much of the mutilation that otherwise occurs.  READING CONTINUES :       In the Fifties, the EBES  Greys  began taking large numbers of humans for experiments.  By the Sixties, the rate was speeded up and they began getting careless  they didn t care .  By the Seventies, their true colors were very obvious, but the  Special Group  of the government still kept covering up for them.       By the Eighties, the government realized there was no defense against the Greys, so programs were enacted to prepare the public for open contact with non human `Alien Beings.        The Greys and the `Reptoids  are in league with each other. But, their relationship is in a state of tension.  The Greys  only known enemy is the Reptilian race, and they are on their way to earth.   Inside a Planetoid .  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness wishes entities to reflect back in regard to these time segments in the previous paragraph, to reflect back in regard to the attitude of the government toward the Greys in the    s,    s, and    s, and you will see also that during such time periods, the presentation of the aliens, in terms of any release of information about aliens, tended to fit into the categories that the government attitude held toward the aliens.  The first attitude being that they were benevolent people who were on a kind of friendly basis with humanity, but as the time passed, this recognition reaching a turning point in the    s, in the late    s and into the    s, wherein it was discovered that they were involved with excessive human mutilation and abductions.      This Awareness indicates that what disturbed the government even more was that they were deceptive to the government also.  They were breaking rules with the government in that they were supposed to be giving a trade for technology.  Efforts to fly the craft resulted in many of the pilots being killed in the testing of the craft, and also the Russians were being given technology which had been forbidden in the agreements between the American government and the aliens.  This Awareness indicates that there were many groups in the    s who represented the aliens as being really nice, wonderful people, rescuers of humanity.  Even the movie, ET, was an attempt by the government to present the image of aliens as being nice characters from outer space.  This was before the government discovered what rascals they really were.      This Awareness suggests that last few sentences of that previous paragraph be repeated; that this not necessarily be typed on your final manuscript; this being for reference to this Awareness, for further comment.  Last two sentences are re read       This Awareness indicates that there is also some tension between the Greys and the Dero.  This reference to the Grey s only known enemy; this in reference to certain elements of the Greys, particularly the orange group which is generally hostile anyway. This Awareness indicates that the reference to the Reptoids in the planetoid, this as being accurate and having been discussed elsewhere in other readings.  These entities coming from Draco:  the number being approximately    million.  This Awareness also indicates that the element    , which is available through the alien government alliance, is capable of being useful in a kind of doomsday weapon against the planetoid.  READING CONTINUES :  Mind Manipulation Experiments:  The Dulce  base has studied Mind Control Implants; Bio Psi Units; ELF Devices capable of mood, sleep and heartbeat control, etc.      D.A.R.P.A.  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  is using these technologies to manipulate people.  They establish `The Projects,  set priorities, coordinate efforts and guide the many participants in these undertakings.  Related projects are studied at Sandia Base by  The JASON Group  of    scientists.  They have secretly harnessed the Dark Side of technology and hidden the beneficial technology from the public.      Other projects take  place at  Area     in Nevada.   Dreamland   Data Repository Establishment and Maintenance Land  ; ELMINT  Electro magnetic Intelligence ; CODE EMPIRE; CODE EVA; PROGRAM HIS;  Hybrid Intelligence System ; BW/CW; IRIS  Infrared Intruder Systems ; BI PASS; REP TILES; etc.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that these areas and names as related to various aspects of various programs and locations; that the reference to Groom Lake ?  and DREAMLAND can be researched in the work of Lazar, the release of information from Lazar, and other sources.  This Awareness indicates that entities can do much of this researching for themselves into the meaning of some of these; that some of these terms are not defined clearly in publicly released information.  This Awareness indicates that the information on Element     as having been given in some of the earlier literature also released by Lazar, and also to some degree, there are mentions in the Cooper Material.      This Awareness suggests that entities can further research these areas for more details if they are inclined to do so.  READING CONTINUES :       The studies on Level No.   at Dulce, include Human Aura Research, as well as all aspects of Dream, Hypnosis, Telepathy, etc. They know how to manipulate the Bio plasmic Body  of Man . They can lower your heart beat with deep sleep `Delta Waves,  induce a static shock, then re program via a Brain Computer link.  They can introduce data and programmed reactions into your mind  Information impregnation the  Dream Library.       We are entering an era of the technologicalization of psychic powers.      The development of techniques to enhance man/machine communications; Nano tech; Bio tech micro machines; Psi War; E.D.O.M.  Electronic Dissolution of Memory ; R.H.I.C.  Radio Hypnotic Intra  Cerebral Control ; and various forms of behavior control  via chemical agents, ultra sonics, optical and other EM radiations .  The Physics of `Consciousness.  COSMIC AWARENESS:                 How Robotoids & Synthetics are Created      This Awareness indicates that it is also on this level that the technique whereby souls can be extracted from the physical and transferred into other bodies or into replicas occurs.  That in the transference there can also be the alteration of memories, values and qualities of the soul, so that an entity can appear to be the same, but there will be certain changes that have occurred that may be unseen, and the attitude and purposes and directions of the entity may then be controlled.      This Awareness indicates that this occurs when the vibratory qualities of a soul are extracted by these electronic equipment from a body and moved into another.  This needs not necessarily be a replica of the entity; it can be a totally different person s body, in which case it becomes what is termed a walk in.  This Awareness indicates that if it is a replica, it will tend to work with the replica to create the final features that result in a duplication of the features of the entity.      That this generally takes place on the almost human form, when the mind state or soul energies, including the various electro body energies are transferred, and as they begin to grow and attach themselves to that almost human form.  The features then begin to solidify, to match the features of the electro magnetic energies and the soul energies and astral energies and other mental and etheric bodies of the older original being.      This Awareness indicates that in the book of Genesis, which states that God made Adam from clay, molded him; this was a poor translation of the actual process.  Rather than clay, it was substance, then breathed the breath of life into Adam.  The breath of life being qualities of the Life Force which were part of the creator, and this was in reference to the electromagnetic field of the creator of Adam,  the Elohim, or alien that created Adam.      This Awareness indicates that this was the process of breathing life or the breath of life into the substance that became Adam.  It was a similar process as the creation of replicas or duplicates, though that took place approximately ten thousand years ago.  READING CONTINUES :      The final statement of the last question:   The development of biotechnologies will mean a revolutionary change in the life of every human being now on earth.  The question is:  Will this be better living through Bio Tech?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that it will be a change.  Whether it will be better or worse will always be questionable.  There will be some benefits that come from this.  There will be detriments that come from this.  There does not appear to be anything that can be done to prevent this knowledge from being incorporated into the Earth s consciousness; it has, in fact, been used by beings alien to human consciousness for tens and hundreds of thousands of years, indeed, millions of years, and it will continue to be used.  It is just that humans are just realizing such strange and awesome knowledge exists.  It will be equivalent to an individual, much like that of the child, who suddenly discovers much to his dismay, that sex brings forth children, for the adult to discover that genetic engineering can create living beings, can alter living beings, can create and alter new life forms, new types of beings.  This is shocking to one who has never been exposed to such reality.                                                                   THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY:   PART   ...THE PHANTOM EMPIRE  READING CONTINUES :       The Phantom Empire:  Above the Law.  The Dulce base is run by a  Board.   The Chairman of the Board is John Herrington.  Jim Baker  of Tenn.  is the CIA link to Dulce.  House Speaker Jim Wright, D  Texas  the nation s third highest office  is Treasurer at Dulce.      There is currently a power struggle going on.  As Rep. William Thomas, R Calf., put it... Part of Jim Wright s problem is, he fails to understand what s equitable and fair.  It s the arrogance of power.   Even among his fellow democrats, many find Wright to be  uncomfortably aloof.   Wright s operating style leaves him vulnerable.      Most meetings of `The Dulce Board  are held in Denver and Taos, N.M.  Former New Mexico Senator Harrison  Last man on the moon  Schmitt, has full knowledge of Dulce.  He was one of   astronauts to tour the base.      In     , he held an  Animal Mutilation  conference in Albuquerque, N.M.  This was used to locate researchers and determine what they had learned about the links between the  Mute  operations and the Alien/Government.      Senator Brian  Nev.  knows about the `ULTRA  Secrets at `Dreamland  and Dulce.  So do many others in the government.  This is what the UFO researchers are up against, so be CAREFUL...they have killed to keep this information secret.  You now know more than they want you to know.      They also have underwater bases off the coast of Florida and Peru.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that all of the above is very poignant, very accurate and very true.  This Awareness indicates that even the repetition through this reading of such information does create some danger for C.A.C. headquarters and the Interpreter.  This Awareness indicates however, that it being just a kind of reflection of material that is already available elsewhere, does tend to minimize the danger, and the fact that the organization is small and the publication limited to just a few hundred people, and the fact that the information is available in other sources, and the sources are being quoted, tends to minimize the danger.      Also, the fact that there are now quite a large number of entities, UFO researchers and entities who are openly disclosing such information, has led to a kind of floodgate opening of such information.  It makes it much less a danger.  Had this information been given a year ago, it would have been extremely dangerous, and those who risked their lives in releasing this information a year ago, in some cases almost two years ago, were indeed very courageous and should be held in high esteem as they could have become more of a large number of victims of the cover up.      This Awareness indicates it does appear that part of the reason this information can be released now, when it could not be released even    months ago, is because there are conflicts even in the higher ranks of government because some want the information hidden, while others want it released to the public, knowing that the public must be made aware of what is occurring if they are to be able to help in the event of a clash between humans and aliens, and especially in regard to the Draco/Reptilian invasion.      This Awareness indicates that those who are collaborators and have been collaborators and do not wish the information released, generally are continuing the cover up out of fear that the masses would blame them and hold them responsible for all that is due to an alien presence, and they fear that they could be seen as traitors. This Awareness indicates that there was a time when these entities realized that masses of human beings were being sacrificed to feed the alien appetites, and that the aliens were not being straight  forward in their dealings with humans.  These entities had a choice of making a clean break with the aliens, or at least informing more of the humans, or of continuing to collaborate and cover up and make excuses and assist the aliens.      Of course, some entities cannot decide quickly, given certain amount of time.  These entities have had sufficient time; that it would appear proper that they now realize this information must be released to the public.  It is appropriate that many within the higher ranks have the courage and the ethics to allow this information to be released as is being done, without destroying the lives of those courageous researchers who are releasing information.  This Awareness suggests that the reading continue .  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       One question:  House Speaker Jim Wright was drummed out of office a few months back for alleged improprieties regarding outside interests, and also for monies given to him by various corporations, etc.  He has been replaced by Tom Foley, a Democrat from our own Washington State, and I d like to ask:  Did this information about the Dulce complex and the alien information that Jim Wright had, was this passed along to the new Speaker, Tom Foley?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this as being information that is not appropriate through this channel to be released; that this would be a violation of certain...This Awareness does not disclose any information that is not already available elsewhere in regard to individuals and their connections with these aliens, in terms of this secret government.  This Awareness indicates that there will come a time when more is disclosed; that this information could be damaging to various entities in various ways. QUESTIONER:  I understand.  READING CONTINUES :       In the      s, `Division Five  of the FBI knew about the `Aliens.   A Fascist cabal, within this country, had John Kennedy assassinated.  Look to the links, within the larger umbrella...the `Web  of a fascist totalitarian secret police state...within the Pentagon:  JCS; DIA; FBI;  Division Five ; DISC/DIS and the CIA. Note:  the Defense Investigative Service s insignia is a composite of the sun s rays, a rose, and a dagger, symbolized  The Search for Information, Trustworthiness and Danger.   Other links are Nazi scientists  who had contact with the Aliens ; the S.S.; Satanists; Permindex; Exxon; the Mafia; NBC, etc.      This links with caves used for `Initiation Rites   all over the world ...ancient vaults, retreats; Alien bases and Inner Earth civilizations.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this all as being correct information; that this also relates to messages given in questions asked yesterday in regard to the changes that are occurring throughout the world, wherein this Awareness discussed certain fascist energies that are in motion at this time.  This Awareness indicates that this is a time in which alliances between some of the fascist energies and some of the aliens has shifted; that it is not simply a matter of humans versus aliens; there are some aliens who want alliances with humans and some who don t, and these are also in some instances seeking alliances with humans, aliens seeking alliances with the fascist elements of humans; other aliens seeking to align themselves with the more Communistic alliance, or that which might be termed the Bolshevik groups.      This Awareness indicates that the alliances being such that it is a kind of struggle in which nothing absolutely clear has occurred, but gradual shifting is making for a possibility that the alien presence can be resolved to allow a human coexistence on this planet, even in spite of the threat of the Draco Reptilians, and in spite of the nature of the more hostile aliens on earth.  There is a ray of hope for humans, even though there is a threat to humanity greater than humanity would have imagined.      The threat of nuclear war as that which conditioned humanity to accept the potential for oblivion, but many humans would prefer oblivion to enslavement by some of the beings whose attitudes and natures see them as mere playthings or food or experimental guinea pigs.  This Awareness indicates there is much that humans can learn from this experience in regard to their own attitude toward animals, guinea pigs, and their own forms of experiments.  This Awareness indicates unfortunately, those who need to learn these lessons most are not likely to have any reason to make such observations and unfortunately too, there are many human cells and parts of consciousness locked into those grotesque creations that are presently entraped in a kind of hellish limbo and cannot get out, because they have been genetically created as a `thing,  yet their consciousness still remains that of humans.  Even if retarded or demented in nature, they still have human consciousness, and these entities continue to suffer.      If entities think that this information is shocking and disturbing to their peace of mind, stop for a moment and consider what these beings who are the subject of experiments in the genetic engineering levels such as Nightmare Hall, are going through.  This Awareness suggests you should sing praises to the Divine Forces that have protected you and your loved ones, if indeed you have been so fortunate as to have lived a good life, and you should consider the dangers facing younger generations who must grow up in a world so totally different than the world you knew in your youth.      This Awareness indicates that there is still, however, a ray of hope for humanity, whereby great things can come about, wherein the Greys have no sense of emotion, but do indeed desire such, and humans can teach these entities in time through some of these genetic mutations, especially their own hybrid offspring; it is possible that race, which is close to a million years in age, can regain a sense of compassion, a sense of emotion, can redevelop an astral, an emotional body, and can perhaps even develop compassion and love, given examples and given time to do so.      This Awareness indicates that entities need to be most cautious in the coming years, love your neighbors, your children, your family. Cherish them carefully.  Watch them.  Do not neglect them.  Protect them, and be cautious yourself.  Your chances are greater, much greater, that you will live a normal healthy and long life than that you would become a victim of alien technology.  That would be most rare in terms of percentage.   This Awareness suggests the reading continue .  READING CONTINUES :     Warning:  Fascism is `Corporatism .  We have passed the point of no return, in our interaction with the Alien Beings.  We are guaranteed `a crisis  which will persist until the final Revelation  or conflict .  The crisis is here, global and real.  We must mitigate or transform the nature of the disasters to come...and come they will.  Knowing is half the battle.  Read the book, The Cosmic Conspiracy, by Stan Deyo.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that knowledge is power.  By knowing what you know now from this information, you are much more powerful, much more powerful than you were before being so informed.  This Awareness indicates in reference to the Stan Deyo information; this book is not available or is very difficult to find.  There is some possibility of acquiring this book from certain sources.  If this book becomes available, you should, at all costs or at any reasonable cost, acquire the book and read it.      It essentially speaks of the planned `rapture  in which there will be the fake rapture, whereby there will be the appearance of an event, a crisis that will lead humanity into the abyss of a global crisis that could mean great difficulty for all.  There may even be the appearance of the rise of an Antichrist, followed by an invasion of spaceships, which would follow the BOOK OF REVELATION, wherein entities would believe they were being rescued by high spiritual beings, and in face, these could well be the humans using alien craft and introducing alien technology as a One World Government is established.      This Awareness indicates that if these events were it take place, prior to     , it is likely to be a fake event.  It is possible that the Pleiadians could return by     .  The Pleiadians  ships are different from the Greys and their appearance is different. Their symbol is that of a serpent climbing a vine, or a serpent.  The Reptilian symbol is that of a dragon.  The Grey s symbol also uses a serpent, this being a cobra.      This Awareness indicates that the Stan Deyo book has been suppressed in this country.  There is some chance of getting copies from Australia.  There are rare copies in the United States.  This Awareness indicates that in regard to the corporations as being fascist in nature; that this is in the affirmative.  This Awareness suggests also that you will recall remarks by Dr. Beter that heads of corporations were being replaced by synthetics or robotoids; in other words, replicas of themselves.  This Awareness indicates that this as having been part of the alien program in order to assure continued use of such corporations.      These entities being replaced are under control, or were under control, of these technologies of the alien and of those who were putting implants into their replicas to control the corporations, according to their general plans.  This Awareness indicates there does appear to have been considerable shift in the alliances since that time, and as indicated, even the aliens may be changing alliances, away from their previous Draco masters, in favor of alliances with humans.  For this reason there is some degree of hope, particularly if this shift continues.      This Awareness indicates the Draco Reptilians do not really need the earth.  They have more room than they need to grow and thrive. They simply want the Earth as a kind of strategic point in their battle to conquest the galaxy.  It is likened unto your army wanting to take a hill, not because it needs more room, but because it wants the hill to help it have better positioning for better conquest.  This Awareness suggests the reading continue .  READING CONTINUES :      This is the final question in this particular reference.       Some forces, in the government, want the public to be aware of what is happening.  Other forces  the collaborators  want to continue making `what ever deals necessary  for an elite few to survive the conflicts.  The future could bring a fascist `World Order  or a transformation of human consciousness  Awareness .  The struggle is NOW...your active assistance is needed.  Prepare!  We must preserve humanity on Earth.  COSMIC AWARENESS:                    What You Can Do About This Alien Situation      This Awareness indicates that this is an excellent summary of the situation.  There is the potential for a fascist domination by both human and aliens.  There is also the potential for a major awakening by the masses on this planet.  The preparation that is needed has to do with filling oneself with knowledge of the situation, and giving this knowledge to other.  This Awareness indicates that as you can easily see, notifying the government or other such authorities of this problem is like letting the fox know that there s a fox in the henhouse.      This Awareness indicates that the important thing is to notify the masses, to notify other people.  Let them notify still more.  Let them notify their preachers, their doctors, the workers on the street, the people in the stores.  Let them notify people who are interested, to notify people who make films, who write papers, who spread news, who write articles for magazines, who speak publicly, who have the ability to disseminate information, to people who have access to a copier, to a printing press.      Notify these people with sufficient amount of information that they can be fully educated and knowledgeable so that they are not spreading information that is half truth, half distorted, confused. This Awareness indicates that this is how entities can prepare:  by preparing each other, by preparing those who are willing to listen. You do not have to force the information.  If entities are afraid to hear it, if they have no curiosity, if they do not dare listen, do not force it on them.      This Awareness indicates that as time passes, and these things become more in the news, as UFOs are talked about more, as the advertisements begin to present more information on UFOs, as the movies bring out more UFO stories, as these things begin to happen, people will want to know more.  Have extra copies of your material for them.  Purchase these books, tapes, study these things that have been released wherein people are risking their lives to get this information to you.  Study these things, have copies, purchase extra copies.  The more you purchase, the more you are contributing to the future of humanity.      Give these copies, loan these copies, sell these copies; whatever it takes to get the information out.  People need to know. Many entities want to know.  Do not frighten entities who are already helpless.  Do not give it to the old lady who is on her deathbed, or who is afraid to open her drapes at night.  It would only frighten her and harm her.  Give it to them in doses they can accept.      If they cannot accept the full dose, give them something mild until they ask for more.  This Awareness indicates it is possible that humanity can survive.  The aliens presently on Earth have greater technology than humans and yet they have this fear of humans because of human emotion.  It is something they do not understand; and remember to wrap yourself and your loved ones in White Light frequently, especially so when you are out in isolated areas, or when you are monitored and feel vibrations tapping into your consciousness.      This Awareness suggests any further questions may be asked at this time or the Interpreter may be brought from trance.              HOW UFO RESEARCHERS GATHER THEIR INFORMATION                    High Praise To Valdamar Valerian  QUESTION:       We do have a few more questions while we re on this subject. In the book, now out of print, called THE MATRIX, by Valdamar Valerian, who s of the Nevada Aerial Research Group, there s a little additional information I d like to read, and ask if this information on these entities is also valid.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness wishes to make a comment here, in regard to the entity Valerian.  This Awareness indicates that many entities may wonder:  How can a UFO researcher, having a group and putting out a newsletter on UFOs, get so much information and have it accurate or worthwhile?  Is it possible that they are simply making up information to print?      This Awareness indicates that in some cases, this is so.  There are some who start out on a shoe string, read magazines and then put out information.  There are many stories in some tabloids that are simply fabricated, made up, but this Awareness indicates there is an enormous amount of UFO information that has been double checked in different ways.  There are many entities in the field of UFO technology, working within the government, working in areas or living in areas near bases, or people who have some relationship with similar entities, and who have some knowledge, many of these entities having spent much of their lifetime studying UFOs or UFO technology or working with government branches that were involved in such, and as these entities reach a certain age or leave their occupation or begin to feel a twinge of guilty conscience about what they perceive as not being the highest and best for the American people, they begin to desire to give this information, to get it out.      These entities often write to groups like the Nevada Aerial Research Group and the entity Valerian; and this entity, just by being there, receives enormous amounts of information from people who have something to tell, whose history and background was deeply involved in this kind of cover up, and these entities often corroborate each other s testimony.  One can say something; five years later, another report comes in that verifies something that came in before, and these entities in corroborating each other, lend credit, especially if these entities did not know each other or came from different backgrounds and had no similar connection, and the same is so for abductees; wherein the abductee from South America experiences the same thing as an abductee from Europe or Asia or the United States, a pattern begins to emerge and that pattern indicates something real is happening all over the world.      This Awareness indicates it is in this manner that information is gathered that tends to indicate a strong validity, even though the information may seem to be out of this world, and even alien to one s intelligence.       This Awareness suggests the question continue .         THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF ALIENS IN THE UNDERGROUND CITY QUESTION RESUMES:       Yes.  This quoted from the book, THE MATRIX.       Grey Species    the Reticulans.  This species is the one most      commonly thought of as being `Greys , and is the one popularized      in recent books about the subject.  This species consists of      beings that exists at  rd,  th, and  th density levels.  Most of      them exist at the  th density level, which means that they are      telepathic in nature.  Those existing at the  th level have no      physical bodies but must inhabit what they call  doll bodies,       or android bionic bodies.  Connection is sustained with these      bodies through chakra points.      Grey Species   is a species that functions in a mode that is apparently military in nature, with a rigidly defined social structure that holds science and conquering worlds to be the prime mover.  What appear to be officers in this society have a diagonal band running across their uniform.  Officers are often  th density, and sometimes retain what appears to be a toy doll that they exhibit to others around them.  It is thought that this functions as a symbol of authority among them.      Grey Species   are about four feet high, have heads that are large and black wrap around eyes.  They also have devices that magnify their mental fields in order to maintain control over humans abducted.  They can withdraw information from the mental field of the human and use that information to form the basis for mental projections that influence the human to behave in certain ways.      Some of these ways include disguising themselves as other humans or other beings in order to gain control over the human being.      Mentally, these species function in what might be termed a  group mind.   They do not have individualized consciousness.  This fact is an advantage to humans because the Greys cannot respond adequately to a sudden shift in what they perceive to be happening. They cannot take a  curve ball,  either psychologically or otherwise.      Grey Species   is a scientifically based society that functions to study other lifeforms.  They have had a part to play in alteration of human genetics over thousands of years.  They seek to cross breed with humans to create a mixture race that will be better than either.       That was the end of that article.  Would Awareness comment as to the validity of that information? COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this as generally correct: that there are seven of the Reticuli species or types.  These may be termed races or species; that species is perhaps a better term for them.  There are also seven types of Reptilians of the Draco civilization.  This Awareness indicates that it can become extremely confusing to get into the many detailed levels of the species and behaviors of such; that essentially, this information as correct; that there are other details that can be added or clarified in the information, but that it is not critical or truly essential to do so.      This Awareness suggests that any further questions be asked or the Interpreter by brought from trance.      Ed s Note: For information on Valdamar Valerian and his      Nevada Aerial Research Newsletter, please write:      P.O. Box      , Las Vegas, Nevada      .      This entity has put together a book in     , called  The      Matrix:  Understanding Aspects of Covert Interaction      With Alien Culture, Technology and Planetary Power      Structures.   Several hundred copies were printed.  The      book contained     pages of information, including      maps and illustrations of alien bases, including their      tunnel network.  Called by many UFO researchers,      the most detailed information on aliens to date,  The      Matrix  was also listed in William Cooper s material      as reputable references.      An interesting note, that backs up the information      just given by Awareness, that bits and pieces of inform       ation comes in to this entity, and years later is verified      by other information.  In the last chapter of the `Matrix,       Valerian included    pages of the UFO information      released by C.A.C. in      and early `  , which included      information on aliens, deros, replicas etc.  In the preface      to this information, Valerian stated the following:       COSMIC AWARENESS COMMUNICATIONS          Generally seen as one of the most esoteric channeled      sources, C.A.C. does present some interesting concepts.      Some of the data does, in fact, match verified data that      we have about the EBEs.  A sample of their newsletter      follows...       The book,  The Matrix  sold for $   and is out of      print.  Hopefully, demand may force a reprinting and      perhaps an updating of this informative book, which      was published by:      Arcturus Book Service,      P.O. Box              Stone Mountain, Ga.            Phone:                     We heartily suggest that if you wish to research UFOs      that you write Arcturus Book Service and request their      latest catalog of used, hard to find books on this subject.      New catalogs are updated monthly.  This editor has been      able to locate quite a few books long out of print,      which Awareness has recommended in the past the      works of John Keel, for instance.  Arcturus Book      Service buys, and sells used books in the UFO and      related fields.  Get on their mailing list without delay!       Avaton            COULD HEAT BE A POSSIBLE DETERRENT TO THE ALIENS? QUESTION:      I had a couple more.  In the Book, *THE ARMSTRONG REPORT:  THEY NEED US, WE DON T NEED THEM, by Virgil Armstrong, he suggests:   We know the greatest weakness of these aliens is their lack of spirituality, but what about physical weakness?  Surprisingly, the answer has to do with heat.  Apparently, they are extremely sensitive to excessive heat and cannot safely sustain degrees beyond    to    degrees Fahrenheit.  Beyond this would be injurious or fatal.       Although I am a firm believer that we must deal with these ET s primarily through spiritual means, possibly heat may serve as a deterrent or restraint.  Something to ponder.       Will Awareness comment on that theory?      *The Armstrong Report:   They Need Us,      We Don t Need Them,  by Virgil Armstrong,      Entheos Publishing, P.O. Box      ,      Village of Oak Creek, Az      .  Price:      $ .   plus postage.   Also available from      C.A.C. although not listed in our Book      Catalog sheet. COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this could be considered as a beneficial weapon in terms of dealing with these entities at certain times, or under certain conditions.  Unfortunately, for the entity s argument, it does not appear to apply to all the aliens.  The Reptilians, especially, do not appear to be disturbed by the elements of heat.  This Awareness indicates it applies mostly to the Greys from Orion, who tend to gravitate more toward the Northern climates. It is partly for this reason that these entities prefer living under  ground than above ground.  Also, they do not like the effect of the sun s rays, even when the temperature of the atmosphere is cool, the sun s rays tend to burn them, and this is not to their liking.  It also is harmful to their eyes.      This Awareness indicates this is fortunate for humans in that these entities tend to leave the surface alone where humans live, except at night, when it is cooler and when there is less light.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       Those underground levels must be air conditioned, are they not, because one would think it would be pretty hot down there that far into the earth.  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative; that generally these are selected areas, staying away from the more hot locations; these being in areas that tend to be cool, away from magma and volcanic lava and such that exhibits heat.      HOW MUCH KARMA EXISTS BETWEEN THE ALIENS AND THEIR VICTIMS? QUESTION:       In this book I just quoted from, Virgil Armstrong has a theory I d like to ask about.  He writes:   The theory expounds that those who are being abducted and tampered with on the surface are in an agreement with a covenant established in another life.  In short, these unfortunate individuals are purposefully born and placed here to serve as spare parts and vehicles of purpose for the ET s in question.  In other words they are to serve the sacrificial needs of the dying and needy ET s so that their civilization can recoup and endure.      If one accepts this, and I don t, then we would have to presuppose that we are already heavily infiltrated with these unfortunate individuals, who in truth would be aliens in human bodies. COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that there does appear to be a certain type of karma that is carried over in a kind of vibration.  This karma as not necessarily a negative karma, but related to a kind of alliance; that it is a kind of pace that developed at some time in the past.  This Awareness indicates that the energies on this are not clear at this time; that the Interpreter as having been in trance for too long to draw strong energy for this question; that one more question may be asked.  FOLLOW UP QUESTION :       Well, this might be the same situation.  Along this same line, I was wondering if the genetic experiments on that level described earlier, those terrible experiments, if there s any possibility that these creatures created were the genetic engineers in Atlantis thousands of years ago that perpetrated similar atrocities?       What goes around comes around...          WHY MOST PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ALIENS                  PAYING THE PIPER AFTER MAKING A PACT  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates that in the forming of a pact wherein one benefits at one time, there is the fee or cost, and there are certain government people at this time who have formed pacts with these entities who have not yet paid the fee.  This Awareness indicates that there are also opportunities by some of these entities to have a second chance to break that cycle of selling themselves to these beings, and if they can break that cycle, there is that possibility of escaping from the karma they would otherwise endure.      This Awareness indicates that the entity who forms a pact at one time in one life, and works for these entities, will return to work for them again, and each time this occurs, the entity will have that opportunity to break that alliance, and if the entity can break that alliance, the enslavement is broken; but generally in the formation of the alliance and the following opportunities of working with these entities, there is a great temptation that is based on greed, tempting the entities not to break the alliance.  They actually feel an attraction, a drawing, a desire to work with, to work for these aliens.  They tend to think of them as masters and want to give themselves to their cause.      This Awareness indicates that it is this cycle and this attraction that needs to be broken in order for entities to be free. This Awareness indicates that there will be further efforts by these aliens to appeal to the greed of people, particularly involved in the monetary situation, wherein entities will be given an opportunity to accept a chip in their hand, an alien sponsored chip in their hand or wrist or forehead, whereby if such is accepted, they then belong to the aliens.      This Awareness indicates that those who at any time accept aliens as masters will be used by these aliens.  That essentially is the harvest, wherein they collect those who have sold themselves to the aliens for some security, or monetary gain, or gain of power.  It is a way of weeding out the entity who wants to follow the follower, from the entity who is an individual who has personal integrity, is integrated as an individual with their own Divine Center.      This Awareness indicates that in centering yourself with your own Divine Deity, the aliens can have no control, can have no hold on you.  If you give yourself totally to the Highest and Best in the sense of the absolute Divine, you are free of any domination by any force outside, but if you lick the toes of the aliens,  both toes , you are their servant until you break the cycle. QUESTION:       Does Awareness have a closing message?  COSMIC AWARENESS:      This Awareness indicates there is much here for entities to consider, to think about.  There is much here to give entities great hope.  There is much here to give entities great concern.  There is much here to give entities something to study, something to reflect on, something to measure their values against, something to put their life in perspective with.  There is much here to give to others, to share with others, to share carefully discerningly with the right people.      This Awareness indicates that it is time for entities to do such sharing.  It is valuable for entities to fully digest this information, reread it approximately three times.  Share it.  Make copies.  Give entities other sources, references for further research, so that they do not think that you yourself are getting your information from one source only.  Give them the opportunity to research it for themselves.  Encourage them to do so.  Then you will have someone to talk to about these things.      This Awareness indicates that this is the beginning of the awakening.  You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.       This Awareness suggests the Interpreter be brought from trance.       The Law of Gratitude is given.       Up to this point in human history WoMankind has taken itself to  the brink of  doom and  returned with  most of our  parts intact.  That is  our  physical members are somewhat healthy. But our minds, our psyches have suffered.  And we are racing toward the time of mutation. Some  of  humanities minds are mutating already.  These minds and  the resulting  bodies will  offer us  a map into our future.        The future calls us.  It calls us  in a silent  voice from  the primordial deeps of our genetics and minds. The very chemicals which make up our minds and bodies are signaling a nearing  of the time of  transition.  It will be upon us soon and if we aren t prepared for the  Changelings to manifest some humans may well start another  series of witch hunts  to eliminate these  precious few new humans. Indeed it is in the best interest of  Four Circuit humans to stifle the advantageous mutations. Otherwise Four Circuit humans will be quickly overcome.        Already the Changelings may be about. Their wisdom has alerted them to the possibility  of persecution.  The Hidden Ones do  well to keep their  existence unknown until the time of Knowing has been reached.        But  we all  won t  mutate  together or  at  the  same  time.  We  have  a responsibility to those that will follow us to create a framework in which they may progress toward positive results. It is to these  ends that the authors are creating a framework to take  Eight Circuit humans into  and beyond the time of transition.        With a small electro chemical voice we are being urged to communicate with you the possibilities of the current  mind mutation. From this brief amateurish work  we will develop a framework  to  help assist  all  inquiring Four Circuit humans on the path to the next stage of transition. CyberCraft is a path toward the transition.  It is  not the only  path either. And  indeed we will probably discover competing  organizations.  Some  may hinder, others   may   assist the transition. From our pursers we ask only to be left alone  in peace. We are not going to harm, only progress. Peace to you and yours.        Hence we  present you with a viable  framework to approach the transition. That framework is CyberCraft. The craft of piloting oneself through troubles to reach the point of transition.        This is  the first printed  introduction and explanation of CyberCraft. In Colorado Springs on October  th of     , I was initiated into an eclectic coven of Witches. Previously I was an ardent Born Again Christian from the Bible Belt of the  South. Over time  I  came to discover  the Christian Belief System, the CBS,  didn t  satisfy my personal  needs. However after  personal searching and synchronous meetings I was accepted into an intimate group of exciting and very wonderfully witchey people.        Two years later in      I felt that the  most important and  life changing aspects of  Witchcraft  were being misrepresented.  American  Witchcraft, among many other things, is an  adaptation of a primitive form  of group therapy,  of extending one s immediate family, of  resource  sharing and most importantly, a better way  of thinking.   But  even after   many years of   practice, longtime initiates seem to not understand the basis of American Witchcraft.        Herein is the first publication of  CyberCraft, an addition  and update to American Witchcraft. CyberCraft is not meant to  replace Wicca or the Craft. It is meant to interpret  the  metaphor further and  provide the needed   time and energy for other deeply needed works.        That s at least what this  author perceives. I m   sure I ll receive  some criticism for trying to add to or improve American Witchcraft.        Which  brings up the  very valid question. Why  attempt to update American Witchcraft when it seems to be doing so well?  There  are many reasons. Some of them are:   o    to provide a more expansive framework for the initiates to work in. o    to accelerate the trend toward some magikal social threshold, o    to emphasize the really interesting aspects of the craft,  o    to further empower the individual, o    to streamline the philosophy, o    to bring it more in line with current psychology, o    to weld the cosmology with current and progressive astronomy and physics  	and finally, o    to provide a more reasonable path of personal growth while having fun.        These are just some of the reasons. We also have a duty to align ourselves with the future,  to  protect and nurture  the new arrivals. Among our children will come the Changelings. And if we gain the power to reincarnate purposefully we ourselves may indeed become The Children of the Changelings.            The first chapter is the proposal. This has  been  published in draft form on  several national  computer networks   as Cyber Wicca.    However after some lengthy discussion with my partner we  came to the conclusion  that Cyber Wicca was too limiting and not descriptive enough of our efforts. The  real commodity is now in your hands as CyberCraft.        The second chapter  is a description  of the  lower four  bio  circuits as talked about  by   Robert  Anton Wilson, a.k.a.   RAW. These   bio circuits are extremely  important   when   considering  CyberCraft.   I    feel it of  vital significance to begin to understand how and why  we think  what we think, which of course, causes us to do.        Chapter Three is Darkmoor. Previously  written about as Chapel Perilous we find it more interesting to call it Darkmoor.        Chapter Four is  of  the upper  four circuits.  These   are  the modes  or circuits  which  we are all progressing   toward. For  once I  feel  we have an intelligent and useful map of our futures. History will be written in reference of what Leary  and Wilson have framed  it in. And because of  the Semantic Time Binding nature of the written word, we ll all benefit.        There are other articles beyond these. Their purpose will be apparent upon reading them.        Welcome  to  CyberCraft. We hope that  the   tradition  will solidify in a satisfying  way,  offering the  participants  many advantages  and insights for piloting their little ships through chaotic seas. 				               			  CYBERCRAFT    The Proposal CyberCraft  An Interpretative Metaphor      Welcome to the CyberCraft Manual. We hope you will enjoy  and benefit from this little exploration into the  majikal mind body complex.  Our purpose is to help others  operate at higher levels  on all  planes of   life.  It  isn t our purpose  to help them just feel  better. Witchcraft has  some very positive and life affirming teachings. The authors of this document  hope to interpret those metaphors bringing them into a  late   th century  framework from which  we can springboard into the   st century.      However we have strong forces  to  compete against.  The first struggle we are involved   with is one of  the  mind body complex.   Who   will control our mind bodies?  Will it be the Aspirant,  the  one looking  for a better life, or will it be  the Controllers, the ones with  the  power and  monies to mold  our minds to their purposes? And will  we nurture the  emerging Changelings?  Or do we let the Persecutors administer the Last Rite to our offspring?      CyberCraft is not meant to be an end in itself.   CyberCraft is the art of living smart.  We hope  that it will  offer the Aspirant the options  needed to create  a  better world to  live   in.   Additionally CyberCraft   is a psycho  spiritual   metaphor  for the    st   century.   This metaphor   is based  upon embodiment  spirituality  whereas    others  are    based   upon  disembodiment spirituality.      CyberCraft  is  the art of  living that integrates rational and irrational process through mythopoetic structures primarily  from Wicca, then neo Paganism and other related religious belief  systems.  It  should  incorporate knowledge from   newer  and  emerging  humanistic    sciences.  Principles   of   ethical self programming as written  of  by Timothy  Leary,  John Lilly,   Robert Anton Wilson, Antero Alli,  and Christopher  Hyatt  should  be incorporated into  the relational   processes; those setting   between  solar   and  lunar  knowledge. CyberCraft is a self modifying tradition.  It  will  change as culture changes. CyberCraft  is  also a psycho spiritual  metaphor which will generate, sanctify and venerate the necessary tools for enjoying a healthy mind and body.             The  above mentioned authors  are helping to shed  light upon  our thought processes. The terms and structures they use should be considered metaphorical. But   they provide a viable framework   from  which  to build  a   newer,  more appropriate belief system for our times.      Humans seem to have a need to be both rational and irrational  at the same time. In doing so we generate quite a few  problems  and reap some benefits. At this point in human time we are not able  to measure magik, nor are  we able to measure or sense the so called etheric  or astral. Providing  that we are given time and if the interests are still mounted, we may be able to invent measuring or sensing devices for such indeterminate quantities.      Further the practice of dividing the mind  from the body has broken sunder the human even  further.  For the purposes of CyberCraft  the mind body is  one complex, one  swirl of energy. The  mind  and body  are one  entity, undivided, inseparable, and indivisible.      It is the opinion  of this author  that  many features of the   powers are misunderstood. Over the centuries and in  various cultures humans have overlaid folk fables and  their personal expectations of what   the powers are  into the framework of human abilities. And in  doing so needless  baggage has crept into the consensus framework.  It is time that we looked at our human nature without the clouded and  marred lens of  binary,  Christian, Ceremonial and patriarchal expectations.      At the base of the concern  humans are animal  by definition.  Human magik should firstly be animal magik.  But does that mean we should be satisfied with an  animal expectation  of what our  abilities can be? Should we  push back the normal or natural boundaries? How far?      The first order of business is to know ourselves. Does this mean know just our bodies?  How about  desires? How about  hopes, dreams and aspirations?  How about our minds? Why should we remain ignorant  of why and how  we think? Do we know now? Or  do   we  think we  know  without  really knowing?  What  part  do preconceived  concepts play in the  formulation of  that  sentiment? How do our respective cultures  help us define  our consciousness?  Are these  definitions useful?  What can be replaced? With what?      It is useful  to frame these  questions in  the milieu of  the human mind. Everything we can think of is thought with the bio  computer we term the brain. How does the brain work?  Research effort is still in progress but at  the core we find that the brain is composed of billions of cell bundles  called neurons. Each neuron could have as many  as    ,    gateways  to other neurons.  We know that information is transmitted electro chemically at about  .   volts.  But we don t know everything yet. And least of all we don t know why  we think what we think.            CyberCraft should be a psychological religious political thought system to meet   and  support  the needs  of   individuals who feel  both a  romantic and classical  approach  is needed in their life.  These  needs should be formatted into solar and  lunar knowledge bases,  ie., rational and irrational modes with relational  processes sitting midway betwixt them.  These should be  used  to a maximal degree.      Humans are  discovering that there  is pity poor little difference between political and religious systems. In  fact religious systems replace  the tribal chief or monarch  with a discarnate  chief or monarch.  This eases  the task of governing  the populace  through    the  revelations and commandments  of   the discarnate  and absent ruler  from on high. Humans always   fear most what they cannot see,    understand  or  comprehend. And we  always   fear  the invisible punisher; the   inner  punisher  who knows   our  greatest fears.  Consequently religious systems are political   systems of  a supplementary order.  Political systems should be considered metareligious systems  in that  political concerns lay at the  base of or  stand behind  religious concerns. Religious systems are political systems of an inner nature.      Understanding our  thoughts should become  a  little easier in   the solar  daylight   consciousness     and  lunar    twilight  consciousness  framework. Additionally many other modes of consciousness could be  mounted which straddle these tropes.  These should be termed the relational or relative processes.      Electronic and  chemical assistance for  modifying  consciousness might be useful in helping to  determine  how  individuals might  drive ethically chosen programming deep into the  psyche.  But once the  message is received we should hang the phone up on chemical boosters. A new generation of brain machine is on the market today.  Recently we have  had the opportunity to  test drive a model of the audio visual and suggestion type. The experience was positive.      CyberCraft should incorporate many of  the  concepts contained in Humanist Manifesto II.      Secular  humanists have pioneered many valuable  ideas  needful in today s ever evolving political  and social  environments.   CyberNauts should  augment some humanistic  concepts  with high  technology answers to  pressing  personal questions. And in applying technology to human service systems  we might make a difference not only in our little corner of the planet but elsewhere.      CyberCraft should  foster  a new  class  of  technology termed  GreenTech. GreenTech should  be  those  technologies which   recycle and/or  conserve  the Matrix s natural resources.      CyberCraft  is a  new psycho spiritual system that  is  more importantly a mode of thinking.  Smart thinking usually  leads to smart living.  Additionally the application of  CyberCraft  to mundane  life  should  be easy and seamless. Instead of taking the individual  out  of the social  complex it  should enable them to integrate easily with the social composite.      All human  structures spawn from  the  human mind.  More powerful modes of thinking are needed to help us along our way in an ever increasingly propaganda polluted  knowledge  environment.   We  should take  into  our  own  hands  the facilities to make rational, relative and irrational decisions void of  fear of the outcome and infatuation of the process.      CyberCraft should appeal to the atheist as well as  the  religionist as it focuses upon mythopoetic stories  and  structures and the mystical  connections between what is and is not seen, as opposed to dogmatic theoretical structures. CyberCraft emphasizes relationship  over religion. This   author  believes that most   of the  world s  religions are based   upon  self deception. These self  deceptions are  usually meant  to smooth   difficult passages in life.   But we should be honest  with ourselves. To know ourselves  we have to cope well  with those human  events that cause  us   much  pain.   Instead of telling ourselves pretty fairytales we need  to work in  harmony with our natures.  But  first we need to know  what our nature is. And   then with greater  understanding we can modify that nature.      The archetypes of Wicca, paganism  and other systems  should be thought of as patterns usefull for programming the human experience  and the relationships between the various existant lifeforms.      In Scott  Peck s   book  A DIFFERENT  DRUMMER   he surmises the  following transitions for the religiously oriented.      First is a  stage of naivete  in which the human mind/body  complex is not programed.      Then follows a phase  of organization in  which the  mind/body  complex is programed  by an  acceptable  religious  structure.  Over time   the individual discovers  that the  religious structure is focused in  ways undesirable to the follower. Stick is mounted upon stone until a way of escape is formulated which provides an honorable withdrawal.      Sometime  afterwards the  individual discovers they are  bitter because of some single or multiple set of  experiences. This stage is  marked by some form of agnosticism or atheism.   It s a  rejection of the  organized systems  which tend to exploit the seeker, the single, the separate and  lonely  for financial and political gains.      Still the seeker needs to feel they are  a part of  something greater than the individual alone. A mystic phase encroaches whereupon  a glimmer of hope is seen in the natural  intricacies of   life. Generally the mystic phase   has an eclectic twist as  the bio  computer  selectively compares, accepts and rejects concepts and structures which  are useful or not.  This experience is intensely personal.  In many cases the experience is not expressible as words to describe the framework are found wanting.      Theoretical structures should be  included  as long as they are considered metaphorical structures or models existing  within  the human mind   first  and foremost. These structures  can  then be  used  to ferret  out  deep   personal meaning.      The paragraph above is the patented anti dogma catma. The  catma is needed to remind us the menu is not the meal;  that mental apprehensions  of a reality are not the  realities  themselves. Meow!  A valuable  demonstration of this is the simple exercise of  saying aloud the  word pinch. Then give the  your arm a good pinch. Think about the difference. 				               External Faces  Public      Domains      Domains  are  used metaphorically. More properly   they represent areas of interest. Higher  and lower  relate to  density more  than social, cultural  or ethical  placement.    However  higher and  lower  still  display some cultural heritage.  Higher should normally refer to  more dense, and thus  would usually be   considered the  Lower Kingdoms  in  most disembodiment   or spirit focused theoretical structures. For  the purposes of CyberCraft  solar processes can be considered High Domain  Processes, the  relational processes  as the Mid Domain processes and the lunar processes as Low Domain Processes.      This  is a reversal of  the usual spirit  based structures which drive the initiate into seclusion  and poverty.  CyberCraft need be neither   ascetic nor bothersome. If  CyberCraft arrives at a framework   which is not  enjoyable the CyberCraft needs to die and be reborn.      Higher refers  to the relative density of  matter.  The human sciences are more appropriate for humans, the spirit sciences more  appropriate for spirits. In the high  domains herbal lore and self   help topics are  more the rule than the exception.      Religious Aspects  Low Domain      The metaphorical Low Domain is the domain of Relationship.  It s the basis of the religious belief system should  reflect WoMankind s ethical relationship to their home planet and humanity.  Depending upon personal focus the Earth can be personified or considered the Grandmother or Mother  of WoMankind. It should be called  Gaea,  Gaia, Mom,  Mother   or the Matrix,  the space  enabling  the existence  of  all  physical and  non physical  local planetary lifeforms.  The involved solar processes  should consider  this a    self  check   to  prohibit WoMankind from polluting their environment to the detriment of all lifeforms.      Other  Matrixes may  exist. CyberCraft   should  be concerned  with  local planetary manifestations without denying the existences of other Matrixes.            The Matrix is  paired with Patrus,  which is  symbolic of everything which has happened to and  upon the Matrix. Included phenomena  are  geologic events, meteorological  events,  intrusions  from outside  the  Matrix, meteor impacts, panspermia arrivals and direct interventions of space faring  races. In a sense the  Patrus can  be thought  of as the evolutional processes  or history of all life on the Matrix. Where the Matrix  and Patrus overlap, intersect or connect, life forms.      Other  personified or romantic  entities should exist   within the matrix. These should be the Lady and Lord and be more important or of a relatively more immediate nature   being seen as  doorways  to  other  entities,  other spaces, physical energetic  natures or psychic  spaces. Frequently  the  Lady  and Lord should be celebrated as the  perfect patterns of  WoMankind. Matrix and  Patrus along with Lady and Lord should be remembered at every fullmoon celebration.      Working of the Craft  Mid Domain      The metaphorical Mid Domain should be the workings  of the Craft. At first the   emphasis should be upon   physical  representations of  the  Mid  Domain. Special tools should be selected for an individual or group. These tools may or may not reflect traditional usage but should  be more appropriate for a culture and/or geographical locale than for a traditional usage.      Special robes may  be  appropriate.  Nudity  should  be more   useful  for metaprograming.   The  individual s  background  should  be considered   before choosing  tools or  coverings. If the  individual were normally a naturist  the metaprograming tool could be robes, etc.      Tools  and rituals should   be used for  immediate metaprograming efforts. Dramatic ritual should be used to advantage for  both individual programming or group alignment.      Experiments in  communication  with  non physical  or discarnate  entities should be a focus. New modes of relationship in sexual or emotional life should be incorporated providing members feel comfortable with the activities. Safety, both physical and emotional, should  be paramount. Training of individuals  for incorporation may be needed to assist them in their growth into unknown areas.      An important focus of the  Mid Domian is the  creation and maintainence of Will. Today s human has been robbed of Will.   Cybercraft hopes to generate and utilize appropriate ritual and programming techniques to accomplish this goal.      Incorporated Physical Sciences  High Domain      The metaphorical High Domain should  be the  human and physical  knowledge systems,  ie,  health  birthing, child  care and physical health , nutritional, exercise, cosmetic and   creative  knowledge   systems, ie.  sewing,   cooking, building sciences,  gardening   and  organic farming  techniques, and  personal defense techniques.      CyberCraft  should  initially provide  the  framework for immersion  in  a Domain. The individual or group should decide for  themselves what  extent they need to go.     Organization     CyberCraft   should attempt to   incorporate  proven  techniques of cell or smaller group management while retaining intimacy.  CyberCraft leaders could be of either sex,  of any sexual preference, but  must  be emotionally sound. They may choose  their own names and titles.  Or CyberCraft  may  assign a  title in order to establish a somewhat formalized but unrestricted tradition. We suggest these classifications:      Aspirant  an inquiring mind of reasonably good health,      CyberNaut  a human moving from Four to Eight Circuits, an              apprentice CyberPriest/ess,       CyberPriest/ess  a fully functioning Eight Circuit human,      Transitioner  a young or eight circuit human showing signs of           physical metamorphosis,      New Human  a fully functioning transitioned human, and      Cyberim  the total complex of those practicing CyberCraft.      Group or cell size should be held to about   to    . However any number of cell members may be used providing genuine intimacy is maintained.      CyberCraft should attempt to meet the economic and  political needs of its members. Resources are available that address political activities in cells. An economic infrastructure  must  be  established  in  CyberCraft method. Should a social  threat arise individual  members may  need  to support themselves  in a strange  or  difficult environment.   Personal  enrichment   and empowerment as opposed to personal aggrandizement should be the  focus enabling  the member to live well in any difficult or strange economic or political environment.      Emotional Requirements      What part does love  play in CyberCraft?  Love in its  various shades  and flavors  permeate CyberCraft.  From love  of Mother  and   Father,  to  love of knowledge and wisdom, to   the lust and love   of  ones lover,  on to   love of pleasure of the mind body complex, love of the patterns  one manifests through, including the  love of changing one s world  to finally  the love of navigating the non  local passages between the worlds. Yes love plays a vital part. But we are not so naive to assume that only one type  of  love exists.  Many different shades  and  flavors  make up  this   rainbow  of  emotion.   CyberCraft should experience and emphasize as many different forms of love as possible. 				               Internal Faces      These are internal considerations not usually presentable to the public at large. Pearls  are  delicate. We  need not dirty  them.  Internal faces  can be determined at a later time.      CyberCraft is a game; the game of Life. Play it! 				               			     Thinkers and Provers: 			     the Care and Feeding 			   of the Human Bio Computer    Editor s  note: The following is  a  loosely  paraphrased  summary of Robert Anton Wilson s first chapters in PROMETHEUS RISING,  Falcon Press       The Circuits      The following model of human  consciousness  employs a metaphor termed the bio circuit and   a  psycho stat.  Each   bio circuit,  sometimes  referred  as circuits, and a  psycho stats functions much the  same as  the channel selector and volume control on your home  stereo. In  our electro colloidal processor we call  a brain we have physical  connections, the physical neurons that contains our memories and processes  our thoughts  and the  information connections, the meaning that is stored in those connections. When  we think  a thought or react to some stimulus  we  use these circuits  by default. We  literally  don t know things that  we  don t  know and  cannot   do things we  haven t  learned.  The bio circuits are the  programs which govern the thoughts  and actions we employ in our daily life. The psycho stats  are  the controls which allow acceleration or  deceleration, the intensification  and diminishing of the bio circuits. Via the use of a psycho stat we  can emerse ourselves in  a bio circuit or turn the intensity down to just a trickle. We have a choice in  how deeply we experience a circuit.      It is  our experience  with others  whom we  share the CyberCraft metaphor that just knowing where one is on the map enables the CynerNaut to  pilot their way to other circuits and manipulate the psycho stats to make their  lives more enjoyable. The Model      What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.  This was stated emphatically by Dr. Lenard Orr. Because the human brain, like  other  animal brains, acts as an electro colloidal computer, not as a solid state computer, it follows  the same laws as other animal brains. That is, organically driven programs  get into the brain as electro chemical bonds, in discrete organic quantum stages.      This is not to say that the human brain is a computer, but only that it acts something like a solid  state computer.   The computer model best fits  current knowledge. Let s review just briefly what we know about solid state computers.    A solid state computer has two chief  components,  hardware and software. Of these the hardware portion is the physical part. It  consists of five necessary parts: a device to process information, the Central Processing  Unit   CPU , an input device to send instructions to the  CPU, the  keyboard,  an output device for  receiving  messages  from the CPU,  the  display or   printer, a temporary storage  area for the  CPU,  the memory,  and  a  permanent information storage device, the floppy or hard disk.    In this hardware model the brain  acts like a  computer in that it receives, processes, transmits and  files information. And like the  solid state computer the devices  or individual  parts of the   brain or computer  are  discrete and manipulatable either by  electro  chemical processes or mechanical  force.  The discrete elements can be created, modified or destroyed easily in one place and at one time.    The other component is software.  These are the  instructions given  to  the computer to operate upon. They,  software is generally plural in nature , exist both inside and outside  the  computer  simultaneously.  While  one can  easily locate the hardware in space  time,  the software is more  ephemeral; it can be in many different places at one time.  One  can destroy  the hardware while the software s  live on unhampered.    Of  the softwares there are two  basic types  of software, operating systems and  applications.   Operating  systems,  sometimes  called monitors or  master control programs,  are  the   backbones  of  software. All applications  travel through the backbones to their appointed ends.  Applications are the individual instructions that  cause  the CPU  to   compute,   to make decisions  and  move information around. Brainware     What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.  Today we have a better idea of how  the brain works than ever  before. I ll get  to  the hardware aspects in a later section.  First  I m mostly  concerned with  the software  aspects of the human brain.    The brain software, or brainware, has three basic parts:    IMPRINTS  These  are   the    more or less  hardwired    physically  present electro chemical connected   programs which the brain is  genetically suited to accept ONLY at certain  points in its  development. These  points are known, in ethology, as times of  imprint   vulnerability.   Imprinting is involuntary  by nature.    CONDITIONING  These  are programs built  onto the imprints. They  are looser and   fairly  easy to change     with  counter  conditioning.   Conditioning is relatively more voluntary than imprinting.    LEARNING  This is  even looser and  softer  than  conditioning.  Learning is relatively more voluntary than conditioning.    Generally,  the  primordial   imprint   can always   overrule any subsequent conditioning and/or learning. An imprint is a type of software that  has become built in hardware, termed   firmware  in computer  jargon, being impressed upon tender neurons before they were fully developed, or modified at some point when they are singularly  vulnerable. Imprinting is  extremely  difficult to  change once  the imprint has  been  made. Some think that imprinting  is impossible to change, period.    Imprints are the non negotiable aspects  of our individuality.  Out  of  the infinite possibilities of programs existing as potential brainware, the imprint establishes  the limits,   parameters, perimeters within  which  all subsequent conditioning and learning must occur.    Before  imprinting the  consciousness of the infant  is  a clean slate, it s  formless  and void .  Another  analogue  is   the exploded  or   unconditioned consciousness the mystics call  enlightenment.  When  the first imprint is made structure begins to  take form. The emergent  mind  becomes trapped within this imprinting  structure; it identifies  with  the structure. And   in a sense  it becomes the structure.    Each successive imprinting adds to and complicates the previous imprintings. Through part  of   this  deep brainware   we  experience life  events which are interpreted in light of the existing imprintings.    Further, conditioning and learning  add  branches to this basic framework of imprintings. The total structure of this brain circuitry makes up our world map and our worldviews. In essence we experience our realities  in reference to and in accordance with the software in our brains. The reality we  know is one that is a construction established and maintained in our brains, our minds.  In this mental macrostructure the  Thinker     thinks  and     the   Provers     proves mechanistically,  fitting   all  the  information  into    previously  existing frameworks. Brainware Centers  The Bio Circuits    RAW slightly  modifies Dr. Timothy Leary s previous     bio  circuits.  It s rather important  to remember that the  following  descriptions are  metaphors. They are something akin to the menu s representation of the meal. It s apparent that the menu isn t very tasty or nutritious. Please remember that each  of the following  Circuits  can be affected  either positively or  negatively  for any conceivable reason to any accidental or intended end. Lower Four Circuits     . The Oral Bio Survival Circuit.     . The Anal Emotional Territorial Circuit.     . The Time Binding Semantic Circuit.     . The  Moral  Socio Sexual Circuit.

Should a bodily  threat occur we  automatically  and completely retreat into  Circuit One operations.   I didn t think  about it, my body just  moved,   the pugilist  says. When such  a  retreat into Circuit  One happens, all other centers are bypassed instantly. Circuit One is the first and oldest circuit  to operate. Some  call it  the reptile  brain. Its earmarks are complete automatic movement and unthinking reaction to a physical influence.    At birth the first imprinting is that  of Mother. Anything  can be imprinted as Mother. Wild animals have  been known  to imprint such  things as animals of other species,  Ping pong balls and Jeeps.  Accidents,  intrusions and intended events can all affect imprinting at this level. Additional imprinting can occur later in life when a bodily  threat  occurs. Areas of  interest for Circuit One are  the   health fields,  martial  arts and any  interest which  stimulates or depresses the human body.      Sometimes this circuit  gets out  of  control.  We leave  the  psycho stat turned fully on or nearly off. Then  it  is possible to imagine threats  to the body that have no basis in reality. The results can be quite tragic. Circuit Two  Anal    Circuit Two is  the next imprinting stage.  Once the  child  learns to  move around it   encounters others. The immediate   Circuit Two  imprinting involves authority. Typically this is symbolized by Father. The child first imprints its relationship with Mother, sharing bodies and food. The second imprinting  is of its relationship to Father. Now there aren t two things in  its universe, there are  three. Along with the  imprinting of Father is authority  conditioning. If the  child does something  good   or  bad  it  learns that  Mom and Dad can  do something. From this triangle political situations arise. How quickly the child learns family politics!    Authority effects personal elimination  potty training. Personal elimination requires  more precise control  of the body.  Mom and Dad  use their power  and authority to condition   the child s    personal elimination.  This circuit  is normally  extended out into the great  big human world with rules, regulations, laws   and  politics.   Bodily excretion is replaced  with  ink and  electronic excretions. It s appropriate to refer  to this as  an anal stage. And  it s not surprising that military and political personel refer to themselves with  shit  or  ass .  Gotta  get my ass outta  here ,   cover your ass, pal,   you asinine idiot,  and   you shit head   are typical  references  to the self  and others. Where authoritarian  or political concerns  arise the human  mind retreats into Circuit  two for instruction. Areas  of interest for Circuit Two  are of course authority structures, the  family, the penal system,  the military and politics in general.    Generally Circuit Two social problems are dealt  with by threatening Circuit One, either with bodily incarceration or by threatening removal of bio survival tickets  money . Circuit Three  Semantic Time Binding    Circuit Three takes us out of the physical world into the abstract. Once the child learns to speak,it senses its relationship  to symbols. It  must learn to symbolize, to describe the abstract.  Circuit Three is  a center which utilizes and manipulates ideas, concepts, facts and figures.    It s tempting  to refer to Circuit  Three as  the Mind .  But it  isn t. The primary expressive organ for this circuit is the mouth, the  portal  from which symbols, concepts  and ideas tumble.  In consensus  reality  WoMankind uses the artificial distinction of mind and body. The mind is the  body  and the body is the mind.    Korzybski said those who rule symbols rule  us. Humans beings  domesticated  primates are symbol using creatures.    If Moses, Confucius, Buddha, Mohammad, Jesus and St.  Paul can be considered living influences, and they  most certainly are for many,  then it  is  because their  signal , their meaning has been transmitted across time and space to our little corner of  the world. Their meaning and  purpose has been transmitted to us by symbol systems. These systems include words, artworks, music, rituals and unrecognized rituals, ie.  games   through which culture  is transmitted.  Marx and Hitler, Newton and Socrates,   Shakespeare and Jefferson, etc, continue  to rule parts of humanity in  the same way  through the  semantic circuit. It then becomes   plainly obvious that  the   symbol system conditions  the information transmitted and thereby    conditions  the  mind which     receives conditioned information.    We are ruled even more, and even less  consciously, by  the inventors of the wheel,  the  plow, the  alphabet s ,   even the various   engineers  of   roads throughout  history. The  founders,  the   religious  engineers of  the   world religions rule  us  through their creations,  conditioning our minds  to accept their message and reject others.    Circuit Three  is  time  binding in that  it provides a  reference >from one point  in time to  another  point. It is also  used  to subdivide and reconnect things, at pleasure. There seems to be no  end of the busy analyze, synthesize, create,  divide  and rejoin, labeling and  packaging of experience. This is the internal monologue  which   is then  externalized  into the  continuum. On  the historical level this is the time binding aspect  as one  generation adds to or subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge and experience.    Since words contain both denotations  referents  in the sensory  existential world  and connotations   emotional  tones  and  poetic or rhetorical   hooks , humans can be  moved to action even  by  words which have   no real meaning  or reference in actuality. This is the mechanism  of demagoguery, advertising, and much of organized religion.    Circuit Three can run away.  The psy stat   turned   way too high.   Persons involved with the higher circuits  V VIII   tell us  that   reason is a whore , ie. the semantic   circuit is  notoriously vulnerable   to manipulation by  the older, more primitive circuits.  However the rationalist may resent this, it is always true in the short run. That is, it is always pragmatically true.    Circuit  Three can  become so  idealistic,  so revolutionary that  a society cannot cope with the rapid change. Generally a society deals with such problems by  a  violent Circuit One or  Circuit Four  threat.  Whoever  can scare people enough  produce sufficient  bio  survival anxiety or  sex guilt   can sell them quickly  on any verbal  map that seems  to  provide the  needed relief from the anxiety. Once  either threat is experienced  Circuit Three is bypassed, and new symbols can be plugged into the human computer.      More will be said later about Circuit Three and its associations with what Richard Dawkins refers to as memes. Circuit Four  Moral    Circuit Four is   the next  center of operation   or mode  of thought.  This center is approximated by the sex hormones awakening in the teen s body. Once a sexual  awakening  occurs  society  has  a perceived   duty to regulate  sexual expression. This circuit could  be called the  Guilt Circuit since it is mostly used to control individuals, not enhance human life.    Imprint vulnerability  is  acute. The first sexual   signals to turn  on the adolescent  nervous system  remain fixed for   life,  defining the individual s sexuality. They lurch about, the bewildered possessors of new  bodies awakening to a new rhythm. Sex!    As any adult can tell, this time is delicate. Accidents do happen which lend to  the  general imprinting which may   or  may not  contribute to   a positive experience. Accidents which impinge upon this imprint are  just as effective as fully intended  ones. Yet time  moves  on. The individual s sexuality develops. Parents and peers all have a  say in the conditioning.  Schools play  a part in the learning process with sex education. Society itself takes a guiding role in Circuit Four defining what is and is not acceptable in our activities.    Circuit Four can be used in two ways to regulate  other circuits.  A Circuit Three social concern can be alleviated by threatening Circuit Four. Take away a human s opportunity for sex and they will consider their options.  A still more useful  way to modify an individual s  behavior is to threaten  their children. Circuit Four  is the  Parent  stage. Society  both  enhances  and threatens the parent with beneficial social programs while hinting at removal of benefits and children. Circuit Tasking     The  task of the CyberNaut is   to  employ  a psycho stat  to  accelerate and decelerate all Circuits in such a  way  as to provide  optimal  protection from outside influences,  liberate    the circuit for   newer,  better  working, and optimize the imprinting,  conditioning and learning  to ethical ends chosen  by the CyberNaut.   By  using  metaprogramming exercises  for each  circuit we can willfully fine  tune  each circuit so that  our perspectives and actions closer match  consensus  reality. Or we may  skillfully   explore  those  areas  which interest us the most. Conclusion      What the Thinker thinks the Prover proves.  Whatever  our perspective of our bodies, our reputations, or our philosophical stance and our sexuality we prove to ourselves  that what we think  is accurate.  Fortunately   we now  know what affects the internal programming. That makes it much  easier to modify our very beings for a more optimal life, more enjoyable existience.    The  above descriptions are  of the  lower four Circuits.  The intent of the article was to inform.  Much work needs  to  be done  in the  way of positively integrating these ancient centers for a better life.  It s time we took control of the  reins  of  our lives.  Long  have  the  medias, the political religious propaganda machines, our  peers  and loved  ones  manipulated us  toward  goals previously  selected.  The  task  of   the  CyberNaut  is to  holistically  and positively reimprint, recondition and relearn toward a purpose of their own.      Between the lower and upper circuits lays a period of doubt which  we term Darkmoor. 				                  In the next article we will review the Upper Four Circuits. They are:     . The Holistic Neurosomatic Circuit.     . The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit.     . The Metaprogramming Circuit.     . The Non Local Quantum Circuit. 				                                           Darkmoor      Between the lower and upper circuits lies a place of uncertainty and fear. It has many names but the CyberNaut refers to this place as Darkmoor. When the individual, through life s events or dedicated study, learns of the existence of newer, better states of mind there typically follows with a time of uncertainty.      Why do I feel this way? Am I crazy? Will I get in trouble? What about my family and friends? Will they shun me? What if they do? These are all typical questions we ask ourselves. Mine was  Am I demon posessed?  Unfortuantely some    years ago I struggled against the flow. I fought myself in Darkmoor. I became a victim of my own fearful projections. I became obsessed with the fear of demonic possession. I was trapped in Darkmoor for ten long years.      We feel comfortable in our four circuit lives. Yet some internal pressure drives us onward toward newer lands. CyberCraft teaches us that what drives us is into Darkmoor is our genetic heritage. This is something we are completely unable to constrain or withhold. Struggling against it is about as effective as the young teen struggling against their awakening sexuality. And indeed ignoring the arousal brings on increased states of emotional dis  ease.      Many of the neo Pagan aficionados have already experienced this time of uncertainty and proceeded. Goddess religion helps us to realize that circuit two and four religious establishments are incomplete because they neglect the body and mind as one unified entity. The universal processes of life reminds us of that unity.      Darkmoor is not a bad place really. It is a time of trying. A time of using new mental and emotional muscles; stretching old ones to newer limits; and of growing new links to the Matrix, Patrus, Lady and Lord. For some folks it is a time of joy and discovery. For others Darkmoor is indeed very dark.      Depending upon one s previous programming a CyberNaut or CyberPriest/ess can recommend some very simple exercises to help the Aspirant to overcome previous mistakes. This author suggests to the Aspirant that quality time while in this area helps to engender quality experiences elsewhere.      Perhaps the best self integrating rituals would be ones which include teachings which bring awareness of the upper circuits. In fact I can t envision a person who would experience harshness in Darkmoor if they were aware of upper circuit material. However an individual programmed to see advancement as evil or demonic would have one hell of a time in Darkmoor.      Passage through Darkmoor can be fun and exciting. But one must become aware of the upper circuits to navigate effectively through Darkmoor.                   CIRCUITS FIVE THROUGH EIGHT:                       CONTINUING EVOLUTION    Note:  The following description of the circuits is a somewhat paraphrased summary of Robert Anton Wilson s material on the upper four circuits from his Prometheus Rising  Falcon Press,      . Quotes from Lao Tsu are from the Vintage Books Tao Te Ching, translated by Gia fu Feng and Jane English; Zen parables are from Paul Reps  Zen Flesh, Zen Bones.  The day to day applications are my own.    While Circuits One through Four are present and operative in every adult human, activation of the next four circuits is not nearly as widespread.  In some, none of these circuits may have ever been accessed, while others may occasionally have experiences of one or more of the upper circuits.  In any case, as Circuits Five through Eight represent newly emerging evolutionary trends, they are at present operative only in a relatively small percentage of the population.  The CyberNaut seeks to increase that percentage. Circuit Five: The Holistic Neurosomatic Circuit    This circuit is typified by ecstatic or blissful feelings, sensory enhancement, sensual pleasure from even ordinary experiences and activities, and a generally blissful, laid back  high  of contentment with the state of things in general. Gurdjieff referred to this circuit as the True Magnetic Center. Triggering devices include isolation tanks, the Hindu technique of pranayama, or controlled breathing, zero gravity environments, and, for the adventurous, Cannabis drugs.  Such experiences as spontaneous regeneration or  faith healing,  feelings of eternal youthfulness, and rapturous acceptance of others/events involve at least a temporary activation of this circuit. Circuit Five control techniques have been employed by yogic and Tantric practices, Zen, ancient Greek psychedelic drug assisted rituals at Eleusis, Dionysians, Mithraic cults, Christian Scientists, Sufis,and probably early Christianity as well.  Occasionally attempts to activate Circuit Five will result in a temporary, although disconcerting, period known as the  Dark Night of the Soul  or  crossing the Abyss,  characterized by painful ordinary physical sensations, generalized bodily discomfort, distorted, nightmarish perceptions, anxiety, and an aversion to or fear of light.  However difficult such a state may become, it does pass eventually into the ecstatic bliss of positive Circuit Five experience.    The fifth circuit, centered largely in the right cortex,  thinks in Gestalts     that is, fifth circuit processes are not linear progressions but holistic, simultaneous perceptions. Neurologically wired to the genitals and the limbic system  associated with the first circuit  and often working through endorphins, the circuit is often triggered by relaxed, playful sex. One who has activated and imprinted this circuit is radiant, cheerful rather than depressed, energetic rather than sluggish, in exceptional health, and almost seems to  sparkle.   The various complaints of the lower circuits   first circuit physical sickness, second circuit aggressive power over, submissive no power, and the associated turbulent emotions, third circuit bewilderment over how to improve the quality of life, and fourth circuit guilt    are resolved quickly and dramatically by the advent of fifth circuit consciousness.  An accurate description of life by fifth circuit adepts is  floating one foot off the ground.  Circuit Five Application    It seems to me that one of the most effective ways to integrate Circuit Five experience into daily life is to work on focusing the consciousness intensely in space time.  Being  here now  transforms even the most mundane tasks into a set of hedonic sensations and virtually wipes out boredom from the working vocabulary.  Paul Reps relates such an ancient tale in his Zen Flesh, Zen Bones:      Zen students are with their masters at least ten      years before they presume to teach others.  Nan in      was visited by Tenno, who, having passed his      apprenticeship, had become a teacher.  The day      happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and      carried an umbrella.  After greeting him Nan in      remarked:       I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the      vestibule.  I want to know if your umbrella is on the      right or left side of the clogs.  Tenno, confused,      had no instant answer.  He realized that he was      unable to carry his Zen every minute.  He became Nan       in s pupil, and he studied six more years to      accomplish his every minute Zen.    When this Circuit Five  every minute Zen  is achieved, one can t help remembering where the umbrella is!  At the moment that he placed the umbrella, Tenno would have been so absorbed in the interplay of colors and shapes between the umbrella, clogs, and the decor of the vestibule, for instance, that those sensory images would have been vividly stamped in his mind and readily accessible to memory.  In this state, the environment becomes a whirling miasma of such vivid sense data that just walking down the sidewalk becomes a  retinal circus : the texture of the sidewalk is a profound sculpture of perfect randomness; the sprays of grass coming up through the cracks are delightful explosions of soft green against the tan concrete; wildflowers along the sides smear their luscious pastels across the visual field, seeming to blossom into the brain itself; trees a few feet away leap into the mind with every gully and protrusion in the bark relieved in vast detail; the blocks in the sidewalk seem crazily tilted and hilariously three dimensional; the sudden whooshing of a sprinkler in the adjacent yard seems a delicately balanced symphony of sound; the sky is impossibly blue against the wispy clouds    the whole body tingles and lightens, seeming about to lift off the ground and fly!  Needless to say, life becomes a fluid, hedonic experience in which boredom is unheard of.    But what about when your bank screws you over, your camping trip gets rained out, your car throws a rod, and your best friend announces she is no longer speaking to you?  No amount of cursing the local deities and trying to force things into your elegantly prepared scheme will do a bit of good.  With that approach, you stomp around the house muttering all day until you ve muttered yourself blue in the face.  At such times the most expedient thing to do is to stop in your tracks, screw your eyes tight shut  assuming you re not driving , jump up and down, screaming madly a few times, then do some deep breathing until you feel relatively stable.  Hopefully, during the course of the breathing your face  and other muscles  will have relaxed somewhat.  Now, you can open your eyes to a calmer world and proceed to plan your next step.    First priority must be relieving any physical pain you may be in, if the means are at hand, so that you can think more clearly. Slow down, tense and relax all of your muscles in turn; breathe deeply and slowly, filling your lungs and expanding your abdomen with air; hold for a few moments, then release, still slowly, pausing with all of the air released before inhaling again. Meanwhile, slowly tell yourself  Calm, calm, calm,  lingering on each sound within the word as you breathe.  Now, take stock of your situation. Exactly what has changed, and what are the immediate implications for you? Never mind futuring; many possible complications may never develop.  Accept complete responsibility for your perceptions!  The importance of the last sentence cannot be emphasized enough.  Through experience I have found that usually a problem isn t a problem unless you perceive it as one.  If all else fails, a simple shrug and a decision to go with the flow, to do whatever is necessary and try to learn from the situation, seems to be the best approach. Struggling against the reality bumping you in the nose accomplishes nothing and is extremely frustrating, to say the least.         As Lao Tsu said,         It is not wise to rush about....         If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.                  ....         The world is ruled by letting things take their course.         It cannot be ruled by interfering.                         Tao Te Ching Finally, yet another hint from a Zen parable: Buddha told a man in a sutra:      A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He  fled,      the tiger after him.  Coming to a precipice, he caught hold      of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the      edge.  The tiger sniffed at him from above.  Trembling, the      man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting      to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.      Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started      gnaw away the vine.  The man saw a luscious strawberry near      him.  Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the      strawberry with the other.  How sweet it tasted! Circuit Six: The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit    Circuit Six is operating when the information archived in our DNA becomes consciously accessible in the waking state.  The RNA  DNA  dialogue  begins broadcasting messages to the central nervous system from within each neuron. Descriptions of experiences of this circuit typically include  past life memories,  reincarnational themes, concepts of immortality, the idea of akashic records, or a realization of something like the Gaia hypothesis, which views our entire planet as a conscious organism, with all life upon it inextricably linked.  The music of Beethoven paints quite an accurate picture of this realization; large doses of LSD inevitably trigger a temporary similar awareness.  Gurdjieff called this circuit the True Emotional Center.    Various cultures have given different names to sixth circuit states throughout the ages    Hindu  Atman consciousness,  Greek  vision of Pan,  Chinese idea of the Tao, etc.  When Circuit Six is initially activated, personified archetypes usually arrive in the personal philosophy, interpreted as  Gods,   Goddesses,  and/or  Demons.  Jung s theory of archetypes from the collective unconscious describes this phenomenon well.  These archetypes commonly appear in the world of dreams; they become more immediate still when Circuit Six is flipped on, often humanizing the circuit as an image of the  Higher Self  such as the cosmic Fool, the Holy Guardian Angel, dwarves, the Green Man, etc.  If the circuit remains activated, the perceptions usually move into more direct visions of a consciously evolving, unfolding evolutionary scheme of increasing self awareness, including awareness of the entire Gaia biosphere, past developments and future possibilities alike. Death is no longer to be feared, since not a single life but a continuous framework of lives and deaths becomes the operating reality.    Circuit Six processes, probably operating from the right neo  cortex, use the many layered language of endless associations and connotations conjured up by each concept    language similar to that used by James Joyce in his Finnegans Wake.  When a plethora of synchronicities emerges in daily life, the sixth circuit is definitely alive and well, mirroring this language of simultaneous concepts in everyday events.    The basic experience of Circuit Six is communion or conversation with the ancient genetic  architect  behind all physical organisms. Whether personified as a divinely intoxicated male or female archetype or defined as an impersonal, amorphous force, the realization is that of a vast life force becoming increasingly self aware and exploring the infinite possibilities that lie ahead. Circuit Six Application    Enmeshing Circuit Six consciousness into your everyday format can be quite an adventure!  First of all, we ll consider working with the genetic archetypes.  The most useful application of these archetypes, in an everyday sort of way, seems to be the practice of  aspecting  or  drawing down,   invoking a god dess  form,  etc. Let s say you re on your way to deliver a particularly complex presentation, and you re understandably jittery.  Take a minute or two to select an appropriate archetype or assemble your own from the genetic archives, then construct a brief, empowering fantasy in which you, as the archetype, demonstrate your eloquence, your balance, your unruffled assurance, or whatever else it is you need for this particular occasion.    In this instance, you might select Connor MacLeod from the movie Highlander to impress dynamic, determined poise and confidence     for the next few minutes, you might feel the ancient sword in your hands like the touch of an old friend, feel the power and excitement of the Quickening  feel the relaxed alertness as you circle your foe, feel the empty space at the center of the peace as you act effortlessly and fluidly, every nerve tingling to the same pulse  feel the quantum leap spiralling upwards zoom as the power of self actualization explodes into you    as you claim the Prize.  Fade to black....   Now you speed on winged boots through memory circuitry, tangled neural gardens, finding the best words, the most effective gestures, just the right degree of enthusiasm to come out shining....  Now you play the Concertmaster, bringing in each element of a magnificent dawn just at the right time with the perfect dance of your baton, while the sky lightens, animals stir, buds open and the surface looks up in unison as the sun appears over the horizon....  I bet you re a lot less jittery now. Good luck!    In addition to archetypal fantasy, Circuit Six has other advantageous uses  namely, peeping at the genetic blueprints for  future  possibilities. At the very least, such excursions will expand your perspective and serve to remind you that nothing is static  that we are not at the end of an evolutionary trend but are constantly designing new pathways into the  future.   After contemplating some of the eye opening realities we can look forward to cultivating, it s often a lot easier to appreciate our current position in the Universing of our choice. Circuit Seven: The Metaprogramming Circuit    The Metaprogramming Circuit is activated when the brain becomes aware of itself as engineer of experience.  When you think of your mind as mind, then think of the mind that contemplates that mind as mind, then think of the mind that thinks of the mind contemplating mind as mind, you have discovered the path to metaprogramming consciousness.  Most methods of  enlightenment  function by leading the student around and around in circles until he is struck by the realization that he is himself responsible for everything he experiences.  With the aid of this circuit, one becomes self programmer, then programs the self programming, then programs the programming of the self programming, etc.  cybernetic consciousness has been attained. Suddenly one is struck by the humorous, completely relative nature of all third circuit reality maps; rigid, dogmatic systems claiming to have the only  One True Way  become cosmic jokes to be laughed at heartily.  The Grand Game becomes visible all at once; creating your own rules, changing them at will, even manufacturing different gameboards for entertainment and edification is what Circuit Seven is all about.    Apparently operating from the frontal lobes, the metaprogramming circuit has been called the Gnostic  soul,  the Chinese  no mind   wu hsin , the Tibetan Buddhist White Light of the Void, the Hindu Shiva darshana, Gurdjieff s True Intellectual Center.  When you ultimately realize that the  self  is not constant but constantly shifting and that the  soul   Circuit Seven  has no form precisely because it dons all forms and sheds them at will, playing every role conceivable  you find you have entered a Strange Loop no less perplexing, dramatic, and funny as a Zen koan.  All that remains to be done is to constantly figure out new ways to create reality  maps that are even funnier, sexier, more inclusive, more delightful, and more entertaining than the ones you were using yesterday! Circuit Seven Application    There doesn t seem to be a whole lot one can say about applying Circuit Seven day to day, due to the nature of the circuit itself; the application in this case is discovering and remembering that as you watch Universe Universing itself, you are seeing your own circuitry in action.  Once realized, this discovery frees you to adopt any metaphors you wish or none at all, to drop them at will, to pick useful elements from each reality map and to discard non  functional ones immediately.  The possibilities from this point are endless.  With the staggering realization of total self  responsibility and self determination comes the creative tension needed to construct, edit, and destroy new worldviews for fun and profit.  There is much to be learned by dispensing with reality  maps entirely, if only for limited periods of time.  As Lao Tsu knew,      In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.      In the pursuit  of Tao, every day something is dropped. And, from the Zen tradition:      Nan in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a      university professor who came to inquire about Zen.      Nan in served tea.  He poured his visitor s cup      full, and then kept on pouring.      The professor watched the overflow until he no      longer could restrain himself.   It is overfull.      No more will go in!        Like this cup,  Nan in said,  you are full of      your own opinions and speculations.  How can I      show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?                            Zen Flesh, Zen Bones    Such a refresher course in objectivity can, of course, be quite startling    if there is one thing that can be reliably expected from experimentation with this circuit, it is the element of surprise.  Situational ethics, relativity, and agnosticism are useful tools indeed; the CyberNaut makes good use of them. Circuit Eight: The Non Local Quantum Circuit    Also called the Metaphysiological Circuit, this type of consciousness involves recognizing the model as a model and proceeding to escape the model itself.  For instance, the circuits we have been discussing theoretically are based in the brain; however, in out of body experiences  OOBE s , consciousness appears to escape the confines of the nervous system completely and operate independently of it.  The OOBE    sometimes triggered by very large doses of LSD or ketamine, various yogic practices, shamanic techniques, and sometimes occuring spontaneously    is one of many liberation of consciousness phenomena which point ultimately to the type of experience variously known as union with all consciousness, communion with the Cosmic Mind, Oneness with God, etc.    Circuit Eight experience may best be explained by Bell s Theorem, which demonstrates the impossibility of isolated systems in a universe where each and every particle is constantly in  instantaneous  communication with every other.  The Whole System is a Whole System,  in other words.  However, Special Relativity says that energy cannot travel faster than light, so what medium carries this  instantaneous  communication?  Dr. Edward Harris Walker says it is  consciousness ; Dr. Jack Sarfatti states that it is  information  and explains his theory with the following metaphor:  If the whole universe can be likened to a mega computer, then the sub quantum realm is composed of mini mini computers.  The hardware of each computer  universe, individual brain, sub quantum mechanisms, etc.  is local in space and time.  However, the software is non local, both spatially and temporally.  Since information is not energy but is what orders energy, there is no conflict with Special Relativity.    In any case, encounters of the Ultimate kind seem practically beyond description.   Words appear completely inadequate; in Wilson s opinion, perhaps Beethoven said it best of all in the fourth movement to his Ninth Symphony. Circuit Eight Application    Language typically proves inadequate for describing non local phenomena, but there are some helpful methods of viewing Universe through a non local perspective.  One most rewarding technique is focusing first on one s own heartbeat, then expanding the focus to include a similar heart or pulse beating in unison within every human heart, every animal heart, then merging with the pulsings of plant life, and so on down to the slow, thunderous pulse of the earth itself and out as far into the cosmos as imaginable, linking with other planets, stars, quasars, etc.  The scope of the imagination is the only limiting factor.  This exercise, performed often and vividly, is a great way to feel connectedness with Universe.  Empathy seems to be a vital key to opening up Circuit Eight; therefore, exercises involving perceiving events/emotions simultaneously from the vantage points of several different people at once are highly useful. As links are forged more readily between people who share an intimate bond, reverent sex is an excellent opportunity for expanding the awareness to include multiple sensations.    Since Circuit Eight is non local in time as well as in space, such time bridging abilities as precognition and retrocognition come into play.  Often, precognition is a matter of trusting your own perceptions more than anything else, rather than dismissing them as  only  imagination or fantasy.  Indeed, neither the future nor the past can be described as fixed, since each person s reality differs so widely, and many possibilities in the running may or may not materialize at any given point.  With activation of this circuit, comes the increasing awareness that various realities are more or less arbitrary and equally valid depending on the framework being used, a logical progression from the metaprogramming discoveries of Circuit Seven.  Finally, the most obvious indicator of Circuit Eight in operation is an expansive,  cosmic  feeling that defies description but feels utterly marvelous. Conclusion    The CyberNaut s goal must be to permanently activate and incorporate each of the upper four circuits into everyday life. These expanded modes of consciousness can and should work with the realization of interconnectedness and relativity of all mindschemes to produce a greater satisfaction with life and a greater sense of humor towards the playing of The Game.  Once these circuits are in healthy operation, every moment becomes a dizzying spiral of intoxication with life and a creative endeavor to conjure even more fun from the ever unfolding processes at work.                     CYBERCRAFT RELATIONSHIPS                          OF THE CIRCUITS    Earth Mother  Matrix    The Matrix is a different order of entity. Matrix is the planet, the planetary ecosystem; the primordial Earth Mother. Mostly the Matrix is the grid of space in which all life lives. Should an anthropomorphic term be needed it should be called Grandmother.    Sky Father  Patrus    Although not previously mentioned a primordial father figure in the same order as Matrix exits. This entity is the Patrus, the Sky Father and represents the external forces effecting the Matrix. Additionally the Sky Father may be considered the original Star  Sky seed bearer. He may represent evolution, changes in weather, space alien intrusions, extra terrestrial biological experiments and or accidental transmissions of life from meteors or comets. Call him Grandfather.      Lady      The Lady is the divine archetypal neuro genetic pattern of all human women. She is the best that all women can ever hope to be plus a little more. The authors will not name her. She is yours to name and venerate.      Lord      The Lord is the divine archetypal neuro genetic pattern of all human men. He is the best that all men can hope for plus a little added on the side to keep us guessing his next move. He remains nameless as does the Lady.    Domain Relationships    Domain interests can and will occur in all circuits from all domains. Each circuit has a high, mid and low domain focus. However some circuits may be more suited to a particular domain.    Circuit Tasking    Again the task of the CyberNaut is to accelerate and decelerate all circuits to provide optimal usage and operation of each circuit toward personally chosen ethical ends.                    Lower Circuit Relationships    Circuit One Relationships    Circuit one is the Goddess circuit. The Goddess is not to be confused with the Matrix.    All the circuits can be moved to or from any other circuits. This circuit can be moved to when personal physical needs arise. Circuit One is an area of knowledge that relates to bodily concerns and needs. Other circuits may be associated with Circuit One. Most importantly for CyberNauts would be the combination of circuits One, Six and Seven. In this mode of operation the CyberNaut would be engaged in metaprogramming towards a happier, healthier relationship with the Goddess. Additionally Circuit Eight may be added in when involved in mid domain Craft efforts.    Acceleration of Circuit One includes all knowledge bases that help the physical organism survive. This is a  do  circuit more than a  know  circuit. Physical health and hygiene are integral to this circuit as well as personal defense measures. Life extension efforts originate in the high domain here.    Circuit Two Relationships    Circuit Two is the God circuit. Circuit Two is not to be confused with the Patrus. This circuit represents all human authority structures. By using circuits Two, Three, Six and Seven CyberNauts can gain healing and instruction with respect to social, familial and political authority structures.    Again this is a do circuit more than a know circuit. Acceleration can be achieved by learning successful teamwork, corporate and political structures. This circuit needs much healing as most CyberNauts have an awful taste in their mouths concerning authority structures and God in particular. Many an individual fears not only external authority but their own internal authority. Rituals should be written to enhance the CyberCraft images of power within. We can and will trust ourselves amidst all the chaos and confusion of a society run wild. Whereas Circuit One is related to the body and emotions Circuit Two is focused toward emotions and external relationships.    Circuit Three Relationships    Circuit Three is the Semantic Time Binding Circuit. It should be associated with the Divine Son. In Wiccan thealogical structures a Goddess and God exists. However nothing is said of their progeny; a divine son and daughter. Most Wiccans know of the Three Faced Goddess. Little know of the Three Faced God. According to the neurogenetic teachings of CyberCraft the Three Faced God is composed of Bright Youth, the Mad Prophet and the Wise Elder. See R. J. Stewart s nicely written material on the Merlin Conferences for more information.    This circuit represents the fiery nature of flowing information and ideologies. It relates more to ideas and ideologies than emotions. Fierce ideological fighting of both an external and internal nature is indicative of this experience. Such shows the immature nature of the circuit. Its mature aspects would be manifest in the free and tolerant exchange of ideas and technologies. Hidden, deceitful, false and inflexible communications are abhorrent to the mature aspects of Circuit Three. However such deceitful communications are pointers to its immature nature.    Circuit Three should be combined with circuits Five and Seven to create more humane and beneficial systems of communicating ideas and technologies. Circuit Three has great promise when it manifests itself in mature form. It should also be mated with Circuit Eight to start processing new research into non local discarnate communications and information networks.    This is a know circuit which realizes the innate value of knowing. Rituals need to be written to acknowledge and venerate the Divine Son. At some point Circuit Three needs to be mated with Circuit Four to produce the next series of circuits. Circuit Three can be accelerated by exposure to new, different and seemingly conflicting ideologies in a non Aristotelian environment.    Circuit Four Relationships    Circuit Four is the Social Sexual Circuit. It should be associated with the Divine Daughter. In previous chapters it has been called the guilt circuit. Typically guilt and shame have been used to control the activities of women of all ages. In it s immature aspects this circuit is heavily polarized being either promiscuous or fearfully abstinent. A balance based upon knowledge should be strived for. In essence this circuit is the doorway into Circuit Five.    Circuit Four should be used with circuits Five, Six and Seven to produce newer personal mythos replete with viable mythopoetic structures ready to serve WoMankind.    Immature Circuit Four struggles indicate an unwillingness to integrate ones nature within the Matrix. It suffers from guilt tripping in Circuit Two. And is confused by the holistic information in a mature Circuit Three. Circuit Five exists to liberate Circuit Four but present conditions in American society lend poorly to complete liberation.    Circuit Four can be accelerated by getting in touch with our own emotions and bodies. Rituals should be written to liberate Circuit Four for more integrated emotions and sexuality. Guilt and shame must be jettisoned to make room for healthy, holistic emotional and sexual lives. Circuits Three and Four compliment each other. Some rituals are needed to integrate the airy and sexual.           Switching Gears into the Programming Circuits    Circuit Five Relationships    Circuit Five is the Holistic Neurosomatic circuit. Circuit Five conflicts arise over what it takes for the individual to feel good. This circuit is the first attempt at taking control of ones own life. Knowledge based upon the holistic integration of the previous circuits enable the CyberNaut to proceed smoothly through times of personal and social stress. All lower and upper circuits can be processed with this circuit. If it s not fun why do it? Circuit Five is the springboard into the other upper circuits. And through Circuit Five we can take that long first step toward understanding and achieving our short and long term goals.    Rituals should be written that include Circuit Five inflections for all other circuits.    Circuit Five is the most important of the upper circuits for the novice CyberNaut. Antero Alli refers to Circuit Five as Chapel Perilous. When the novice first ventures through the previous Circuits they form stable relationships between themselves and their world. However Circuit Five has the tendency to change previous programming. This Circuit upsets the apple cart. A seemingly instantaneous realization occurs that things aren t what they really seem to be. Now everything is in doubt. Nothing is sure. Only the brave and mature should venture into Chapel Perilous. But as can readily be seen, life seems to propel us into Circuit Five whether we are ready or not.    Circuit Six Relationships    Circuit Six is the Collective Neurogenetic Circuit. By way of Circuit Six we can begin writing and integrating personal mythologies concerning what we are and where we want to go. This circuit allows us to explore the hidden spaces of our aspirations while hinting at intelligent, ethical control of our psychic  selves. This circuit should be combined with all other circuits in ways that allow deep penetration of personally chosen data into human psyches. Circuit Six will apply mostly to the mid and low domain.    Priestesses we know tell us of the emotional and energetic charge they receive when performing the Charge of the Goddess. In Drawing Down the Moon Circuit Six is in full operation. Through the Charge of the Goddess this Circuit offers a neurogenetic link to Circuit One. In doing this we gain a mythopoetic view at our pasts and futures.    For men we have a ritual called Drawing Down the Sun. Circuit Six offers men access to neurogenetic links which offer the same insights but from the God s aspect of Circuit One.    Circuit Seven Relationships    Circuit Seven is the Metaprogramming Circuit. This is the second most important circuit for the novice CyberNaut. In Circuit Seven operations the CyberNaut can and will discover, analyze and repair all previous circuit disfunctionalities. As with Circuit Five it should be associated with all other circuits. This circuit is critical when accelerating and decelerating circuits.    Circuit Eight Relationships    Circuit Eight is the Metaphysiological or Non Local Quantum Circuit. Here circuit tasking is a little different. The goal of Circuit Eight activities is to escape the model itself, freeing the entity to experience as clearly as possible non local existence. Typically Eight is used with all circuits to step outside the framework for new perspectives.    Circuit Eight is the walk way to higher states of being. As life extension and personal research enable new personal and common vistas this circuit becomes more important.                    External and Internal Faces    All the Circuits involve open and hidden aspects. But what is a hidden aspect? The hidden aspects are modes or techniques which may be viewed as extremely negative by our culture. CyberCraft is a continuation of knowledge which was not received well by our contemporaries. Consequently any practice which may bring prosecution or unusual persecution should be considered an internal aspect. This is to protect the CyberCraft.    As examples  followers of Lyndan Larouche have already penetrated certain neoPagan and Magickal computer networks, gained information and published pamphlets publicly branding the networkers as Satanic devil worshipers utilizing a nationwide Satanic computer network designed to help facilitate the stealing of innocent children from the Christian enclaves. Is it presently rumored that some reportedly armed right wing organizations are collecting names and addresses for their databases. The South Western Radio Church has long been on an anti newage campaign and can t be far behind. Some federal agencies have penetrated networks of pedophiles and gathered names of suspects from the owners and users of the network.    Under no circumstance is a public access computer network to be considered secure. Use encryption programs that are DES based to provide the needed security. Pass the keys by first class mail. Code the keys in questions or stories that only CyberNauts would understand.    The external face can be discussed freely in public environments. The hidden face should be discussed only between members or between members and trusted inquirers. And then only the knowledge needed should be exposed.    For the internal faces written and electronic telephone line or air radiated communications should be encrypted in such a way as to provide a reasonable measure of security. Leave no unencrypted internal face material open to accidental discovery by children or neighbors.    This author s experience with government agencies is that some      governmental agencies keep and maintain information on individuals. Once these agencies acquire negative information much time, money and effort is required to purge their records. Even then one is never sure an agency has not simply refilled the information in different areas to retain the disputed information.    Privacy is a vital practice. This may seem paranoid but a general practice of privacy can only benefit us.                  Sharing Bio circuit Experiences      Bio Circuit   Experiences      I have had some very wonderful experiences with the upper   circuits. Some of this may sound threatening but I hope not too much.      Between circuits   and   is a place I call Darkmoor. Antero Alli terms it Chapel Perilous.  I ll see if I have info. on Darkmoor on the E Net.  Darkmoor is the region of doubt we experience when we begin to notice the upper   circuits. Some, perhaps most of us, start thinking that we are betraying our parents, sometimes our peers, and perhaps ourselves when we modify our lifestyles toward circuit  . After all most of us were taught from early on that we had to  work hard  to live. Circuit   lets us know that we can enjoy ourselves, even be a little lazy when we need, or when we want.      The upper circuits do somewhat parallel the lower circuits. The bodily feel goodness of circuit   is paralleled and amplified in circuit  . For most people life can be good, for some it can be great, yet others live fantastic lives. Generally when we learn not to fight ourselves, our general need to feel good and be happy, we learn to live well.      About a year ago I met the young wife of younger friend, who through their own doings were coming to terms with an impending divorce. In the months after we met she and I were synchronously thrown into  things  together. We began to see and sleep with each other during their separation. She moved in with me some months before their divorce was final. Jim, her ex, has shown great integrity throughout the process and now seems to have resolved his concerns about the divorce. Both Jim and Alisandra made it through their problems by using circuit  , the holistic neuro  somatic pleasure circuit. By indulging themselves in pleasure they found that their previous relationship was pretty shaky from the beginning. Since they both are fairly independent their new lifestyles are much better than their old one.      For them, in their need, circuit   worked well. They had no idea that circuit   existed. But they naturally used the processes of this circuit to help them get through. Sure it was tough, but not nearly as tough as others.      Alisandra is    years my junior. I tend to  worship  youth and beauty. So I surround myself with people I think of as youthful and beautiful. In my social intercourse my friends and I deal with people our age down to college students. Since I have no surviving family and Alisandra s fundamentalist parents in Tennessee think she is  possessed by the Devil   by me??  neither of us have older, cranky parents to deal with.      Currently for us circuit   is the main circuit. We take our pleasure any when and where we desire. And with anyone we desire. Sure we have our little spats but we both know the rules of communication. We deal with the little stuff before it pile up. She knows about my minor blood sugar problem so we don t get into arguments when my body decides to do something different.  I ve been told by lovers  You re cranky in the morning.  Isn t everybody??      Sometimes I wonder how the grasshopper felt. Did he really think that winter wouldn t come?? If we take our pleasure constantly will we miss some other important event? Yes. Tim Leary writes that people  stuck  in circuit   think having fun is too important to be weighed down with commitments and progress. Those stuck in circuit   find it extremely difficult to even notice the upper   circuits.      The general warning is that there is always something else to learn, to experience. Till things go  non local ,  exponential  and/or  non linear  in circuit   we always have another circuit to experience.      One other important point. Infact it s a large consideration. Health, no not just sexual health, but health in general. Exploring circuits takes time. Without a healthy body and mind the fun of exploration is diminished, perhaps even precluded.      In this model life extension is a vital part. Writer Paul Bragg, who influenced Jack Lalane, made it to    with all his teeth and normal vision, running   miles a day and swimming a mile on occasion. Alas due to an unfortunate accident Paul Bragg is no longer with us.      There is no reason why we can t live to     or    . Health is part and parcel of circuit  . What does it benefit us to be kings and queens if our health is failing? Yet with good health of mind and body even paupers have the opportunity to become wealthy. With the emergence of micro  and nano technology in    years or so, we may have the tools to extend life to     hundred years. Some visionaries tell us that  because technology is exploding exponentially, in the coming century we may find ways to extend life indefinitely. Or perhaps until the individual decides it s time to die. It d be a shame to die the day before immortality machines are brought online.      Along with life extension comes greater ability to cope with change. In a     year life cycle comes the ability to cross train in several different fields of study. Then after they have been assimilated a cross discplinary approach to the tough problems can be used to better solve those problems.      Of course a     year lifecycle also means about     years of pleasure in circuit  . That s quite a consideration.      Circuit   experiences      Circuit   experiences concern the Collective Neuro genetic Relationship      Alisandra and I have been involved with neo paganism for a few years. While neither of us believes in a real Goddess or God we do see the value in this for some people. However what appeals to us are collective neuro genetic archetypes. Please read Jung s work on archetypes for established and accepted definitions of archetypes.      To us archetypes are patterns in both the conscious and unconscious that  program  windows of action or opportunity for us. Archetypes can be either the individual s genetic coding  programming  or a culturally determined way or mode of experiencing life.      Alisandra likes Connor MacLeod from Highlander. In this story a young immortal must confront his immortality, ignorance and conflict with other immortals for a fabulous prize. Here is the powerful story of the mythical Hero s Journey. It is the story of all human life. Expanding consciousness can be substituted for immortality and the story is much the same.  And as presented in the previous reply consciousness may indeed bring to us practical immortality.       Circuit   helps us get in touch with our past, present and future history. Some folks think that the current state of humanity is the culminating state. I think not. In a million years or so we may find as many different types of humans as we find in other different but similar species.      Part of circuit   is aspecting a neuro genetic archetype. Some folks call this channeling; and while they think they are channeling a discarnate entity from elsewhere I have my suspicions. In my life I have noticed a semi major personality change about every     years. To me the current personality is a variable composite of past personalities. It s variable in that it is a changeable forum or quorum of memories, thoughts and feelings that make up Mike. In this quorum there are stronger and weaker individuals. Each play their own part in my psyche. If I allow a change in the quorum these internal changes are evident to me and close friends.      Aspecting  channeling  is changing the forum, rearranging the quorum for a different perspective or view of reality. Modern channelers then speak and act differently than normally. But we don t need to be channelers to get in touch with the collective neuro genetic patterns.      I said I d share.  But I didn t say I would lecture a bit too. Along with aspecting is something similar I term virtual personalities. I have a virtual personality named Ammond. He lives in a somewhat different world than Mike. But he has much the same outlook.      Virtual personalities, sometimes called alter egos, are pretty much the same thing as a Fantasy Role Playing entity. Those who have played Dungeons and Dragons are familiar with FRP games. But what has gaming theory got to do with life? Almost everything. Life has rules, regulations and consequences. Games have the models of those very same things.      Tim Leary got into hot water with  games  in a time when life was a serious matter. Early in Joseph Campbell s book PRIMITIVE MYTHOLOGY Joe talks about different culture s approaches to life. One approach is that life is a game to be played. I like that approach myself. If we make ourselves perceive life as a game we can have fun with the game. Sometimes we can even get away with mucking with/the rules. Consequences are there though...      In Mike s life Ammond is part of the game of aspecting a neuro collective archetype we know of as witch or magician. Others play this important game with him. Alisandra played for a while too. Both of us got tired of that game so we have mucked the rules, plotted a different course to the stars again. We are starting in another direction. But the archetype s  is deep within our psyche. We can no more escape them than we can escape our own arms.      An advantage of being able to muck the rules is that we can determine what we can and cannot get away with. American culture is very restrictive. Getting in touch with the genetic archetypes enable us to experiment, to know, to be flexible enough to shape  shift into a new personality at whim. Our participants who are actors can identify with this concept.      In current psychologies we have models including only three entities  child, adult and parent. However these are a basic three in many thousands. The collective neuro genetic circuit gives us the opportunity to emulate any of those thousands of internal, genetically and culturally driven archetypes.      Just for fun, here are a few words from Ammond...       The witch is a powerful person because they learn to turn, bend, shape and condition reality. Life is a marvelous thing when one realizes that magick does indeed work. Through magick I can create, modify or condition anything in my life. That s fun and I benefit greatly.       Thanx Ammond. And now a few words from another important person   Arthur C. Clarke...  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Of which Ammond bends into  To the culturally xenophobic any sufficiently different technology is indistinguishable from magic, ie. pure garbage.       Circuit   experiences...      What can be said about circuit  ? Lots of things, but these statements are almost in a different language. Something not in English. In its most basic aspect circuit   is the point in the individual s development where they begin to understand how they program, influence, and condition their own minds. The programmer takes control of the program to design in or erase out those functions useful or not. This includes feelings and emotions.  Glasser s Perception orders give us a hint as to how to use circuit   better.       Circuit   is the metaprogramming circuit. Dr. Lilly has a lot to say on this subject in some of his books. I think Center Of The Cyclone and Programmimg And Metaprogramming The Human Biocomputer both address this topic. I haven t read the latter at this point. It s on my list of a hundred or so.      In other topics I refer to the human mind/body complex as a single somewhat mechanical entity. Robert Anton Wilson says the brain is something like a silicon computer. Cyber punks term the brain  wetware . They even go as far as to distinguish between minds, ie.  meat mind  and  machine mind .      In K. Eric Drexler s Engines Of Creation  The Coming Era Of Nanotechnology, he starts his book off writing of the machines that inhabit the human body. Each human cell is inhabited with millions of tiny nanomachines. And today we have the beginning of the capability of sensing, viewing, controlling and creating newer, more useful nanomachines. Obviously our understanding of the word machine is evolving.  Perhaps you have heard recently that folks at IBM labs have the ability to manipulate individual atoms. In    hours with a scanning tunneling microscope they moved    xenon atoms across a nickel surface to spell out IBM. It was difficult and slow, but it was done. Additionally genetic researchers on the East Coast are asking for children with genetic conditions to volunteer for genetic manipulation and testing. They think they can  fix  the bad chromosones.       The human body and by extension the human brain  wetware  is composed of individual micro and nano machines. So by extension we can think of the human brain as a macro machine  in light of the littler machines that make its composition.  As time proceeds, technology and human knowledge progress. Even the understanding of  technology  and  knowledge  changes with new information. The understanding of  human  and  mind  changes even as you read this reply.      Today we are on the verge of a radical change. Additionally, radical changes in our paradigms are happening now. Either our individual worldviews keep up with existing useful knowledge or we will grow  strange , alienating ourselves from the force of the march of the race toward the stars.      One of these paradigm changes is one which considers the human animal more machine and less a metaphysical entity. By extension we can also say that the human mind is more machine than metaphysical entity. A truly advanced, conscious and replicating, self modifying, amazing machine, but a machine it remains. This disturbs many metaphysical minded folks because it has ominous consequences, the most ominous being that if WoMankind is basically a machine then what about an afterlife? According to this model unless some vehicle is generated to contain human consciousness there is no life after death.      Continuing on... Just like a computer we can program our minds. School is the primary place of programming. Learning is taught very little in schools. Students are supposed to open their minds to let the teacher pour in the socially accepted, accredited programs. It s no wonder our children hate school. They have the genetically driven need to learn, but they perceive they are being programmed. Programming and learning are not the same thing. Our children perceive the hypocrisy. I rebel against the idea myself.      However ethical self programming is a different item altogether. Folks like Leary, Wilson, Alpert, and Lilly, tell us that some techniques can indeed change our minds. Techniques like focused meditation, positive visualization, brain machines and chemical alteration are powerful tools for brain change.      Personally I ve used positive visualization to some success. Focused meditation is probably the best current legal technique. More powerful techniques are brain machines which use a feature of the brain to train the brain into semi discrete states while listening to motivational tapes. The most powerful and most dangerous tools are psycho active drugs. These are generally used to demolish existing emotional structures which might compete with the newly forming, more delicate emotional structures. This wrecking crew is composed of any of the psycho active drugs available. The most popular are LSD,  shrooms, XTC and pot. All of these drugs tie back into circuit   so there is a double whammy involved with their usage. For some people demolition of emotional structures works well. Others would just freak.      Currently these drugs are illegal. Our society has some difficult problems to face with respect to mind altering substances. The primitive  and now our contemporary  shaman has used plant substances to alter brain chemistry for some   ,    years. I have a fairly extensive reading list for these metaprogramming substances. Perhaps this is subject matter for an addendum.      Brain machines and disciplined meditation seem to be the most powerful legal tools. These are able to softly rearrange the minds programming without demolishing whole structures. As time marches on brain machines will progress. I presume that at some point, the most powerful models will become illegal. Figures.      Circuit   experiences...      Circuit   is very mystical. Writing about circuit   for me is difficult. I have a limited understanding of it. This is probably because Mike is a   circuit person. However Ammond is an   circuit person so maybe I should let him take over for awhile... <tee hee>      Hey, Ammond. Wake up!       Uhhum, what? Oh, circuit   is the metaphysiological circuit. This can be interpreted in two ways.  This is boring you know. Mike doesn t really like this stuff so i think it s a great idea to let the experts cover their fields. He can be such a stuffed shirt at times. You fundamentalist! Get a clue Mike! Let go. Have fun. Jeeze, it won t hurt your reputation too much. People won t think you re crazy or nothin.        I dislike self made, so called experts turkey. Did you know that an expert is a  has been drop of water under pressure??        Ok, let s get on with this...  i knew we weren t going to get anywhere. He s supposed to be writing this stuff, not me. Always leaving it to the little guy.  Ok, where did i leave my magick book? Here it is under the pickled frogs. Jeeze i hate that smell... This whole place has that horrid smell. Should open some windows. It s springtime. I m giving up pickling small animals. The larger ones can stay in the yard...      Circuit  , yes i m familiar with that area. Any progressive magician is, or rather should be. The term magick is a squirrely thing. It s hard to pin down. It took me almost a year and a few thousand pins to get it pinned down on my magicians viewing matrix. Darn pins, kept backing out somehow. Magick. Hummpf!      It can been seen in two lights. One is the mystical view, which i subscribe to. i couldn t be a real magician if i didn t. Rules you know. Damn unions, always making impromptu proclamations. Do this, do that. Believe this. I m ready to quit and become a customer service engineer. I can fix anything. At least i could make some real money. Might even get a car...      Where was i? Oh yeah, two lights. Some folks like to believe in mysterious metaphysical powers. It all works together you know. Somehow. Like attracts like in contradiction to current physics. So whatever you work for you somehow magickally get. Or at least something like what you wanted. Hard to tell at times. It generally depends upon how much you want something. And how hard you work at it.      The other view is that natural laws haven t been fully appreciated, uhh, understood yet. This revolves around strange things like  information  and  consciousness ,  charm  and  quarks  and such intellectual sillyness. Generally the idea is that we are all linked in a network of sorts. When we find the proper technologies and applications we should be able to slide around on the net, doing and going to different places in a flash. Sounds like hooey to me. i prefer magick, it s simpler.       Thanx for that helpful explanation Ammond, I ll take it from here. Cranky this morning??       Not a damn bit!       Know what you re doing?       Yep, it s all in this here magick book. Cernunnos on a crutch! Where did it go? Magick book, hummph! Just about gotta  keep it on a steel leash. Here it is under the pickled snakes. I ll just mosey over and put it back where it belongs. Oh yeah, the front door is open. Bye. Don t make a mess on the way out, will ya ? This stuff is hard to replace. Where d that infernal book go?       Ok, to continue from the previous paragraphs. Quantum physics has been bringing us some strange information. Mostly it says that our views of the universe affect our perception of the universe so what we think we see is really something else. Or something like that. You ll have to get the information yourself. There are some good and bad books on this subject. Be careful of what you pick up at the bookstore. Somehow those books jump right off the shelf at you saying buy me, read me. You d think there was something magic about it all.      Experiencing good synchronicity is a good example of circuit   being active. Jane Roberts, another aspecter of fame, has a lot to say on following one s impulses. Of course Jung is the one who coined the term Synchronicity.                      The Cyber Lord and Lady      The CyberLord      Since this article is being written in the late Fall we ll start with the Lord first.      Who is the CyberLord? In Wicca the horned Lord is the Consort of the Lady. His seasons are from Autumnal Equinox to the Vernal Equinox. Typically He represents life cycles, birth through death. But since CyberCraft is an interpretive metaphor we will try to get a little closer to Him.      CyberCraft holds that the Lord is the divine natural pattern of all men. His appearance and lifestyle would depend upon the culture in which the CyberNaut lives. Skin color, language, lifestyles are all dependent upon one s culture and need.      We are told by our predecessors that we don t create the Gods, we name them. Yet some might pursue a natural manifestation that is a little too far or distant for the individual to maintain a solid psychic link with. Mireca Eliade tells us that supreme Gods generally always are replaced with more local, more relative, lesser Gods. Therefore we offer the Cyber Lord as that more relative and personal deity.      His home is the homes of men, His loves the loves of men. He is the complete and perfect pattern of all human males. He is the best of all possible human male entities. His abilities are the highest that mankind can ever hope for plus a little to keep us guessing. And He is complete in his animalness. Raw viral power is His to command. His keen, perceptive, piercing intelligence tracks the quarry from birth to death. His building and engineering skills are sufficient to take mankind from dank cave to reliable inter  stellar, inter galactic transportation systems.      He is the seed bearer. His semen can fecundate while His powers can decimate. Half the information codes that terra form new Gaias frolic within his divine form. His nature is of fire and air   of doing.      But He is not a goody two shoes. He knows the way of birth and death, of creation and destruction. He knows that in open and closed systems, placement and replacement both have a place in the dance of whirling, living systems. He has a dark side but it s not evil. His is a life affirming darkness as opposed to life denying darkness. There is a life denying darkness. It lies in the realm of Patrus.      The CyberLady      She, like the Lord, is the divine pattern of all women. The best they can ever be plus just a little to surprise us. She is the Creatrix of the race, and with Her links to Gaia she is the matrifocal property owner of the race. Hers is more a creating and nurturing spirit where the Lord s is knowing and doing. From Her breasts comes the multi visceral ambrosia which sustains all human life. Her Nature is of water and earth  of sustaining.      Her form is also relative to the race and culture of the CyberNaut. She has a light and dark nature but again they are life  affirming. The Matrix contains life denying processes. Her form is a evolutionary raised animal form reflecting both woman s primitive and star nature. She will bear us across the wide heavens to newer homes.      Equivalencies      The Lord and Lady share many of the same powers. This is reflected in our genetic heritage. Neither Lady nor Lord is supreme. They are the powers of the species. And they do not serve the other except in the genetically driven processes assigned by the Matrix and Patrus. They are equal but completely perfect in their separate abilities.  Both serve the Matrix and Patrus, not by Commandment, but by pattern and nature.      Representations      Each CyberNaut, CyberPriest and CyberPriestess has the power and authority to create representations of the Lady and Lord. Were it not so we would not have the power and authority to procreate >from Their genetic stocks.      This author envisions the Lord as younger, utterly handsome, virile, with short hair and a strong energyform body. I see Him as agile and adept at plumbing the sub atomic depths and the brilliant cores of galaxies.      The Lady is dark and divine. Her beauty stupefies and exhilarates. Her cool touch electrifies and energizes. Her breath animates. Her single glance can mortify and elevate a human to seventh heavens.      Their powers spring from within and reach to the outermost realms of matter and energy. Nothing is beyond their caress.      Changelings      From the effects of the Lord and Lady come the progeny who we call the Changelings. Those who are mutating the minds are the mental Changelings of the Divine Couple. And as time progresses our bodies will change as the Lord and Lady prune, shape and nurture the human species. We are involved in a labor of love in creating a framework to benefit our children and our future selves. This is from a book called the Blue Island published shortly after the Titanic sank.  It is in the public domain, and claims to be channeled from one of the victims of that event.                  A Letter from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Dear Miss Stead,   I found the narrative most interesting and helpful. I have no means of judging the exact conditions under which it was produced, or now far subconscious influences may nave been at work, but on the surface of it, speaking as a literary critic, I should say that the clear expression and the happy knack of smiles were very characteristic of your father.    We have to face the difficulty that the details of these numerous descriptions of next spheres differ in various manuscripts, but, on the other hand, no one can deny that the resemblances far exceed the differences. We have to remember that the next world is infinitely complex and subdivided   {My Father s house has many mansions}   and that, even in this small world, the accounts of two witnesses would never be the same.    If a description were given by an Oxford don, and also by an Indian peasant, their respective stories of life in this world would vary much more than any two accounts that I have ever read of the world to come. I have specialized in that direction   the physical phenomena never interested me much   and I can hardly think that anyone has read more accounts, printed, typed and written, than I have done, many of them from people who had no idea what the ordinary Spiritualist scheme of things might be.    In some cases the mediums were children. Always there emerges the same idea of a world like ours, a world were all our latent capabilities and all our hidden ambitions have free and untrammelled opportunities.  In all there is the same talk of solid ground, of familiar flowers and animals, of congenial occupations   all very different to the vague and uncomfortable heaven of the churches.    I confess that I cannot trace in any of these any allusion to a place exactly corresponding to the Blue Island, though the color blue is, of course, that of healing, and an island may be only an isolated sphere   the ante chamber to others.    I believe that such material details as sleep, nourishment, etc., depend upon the exact position of the soul in its evolution, the lower the soul the more material the conditions. It is of enormous importance that the human race should know these things, for it not only takes away all fears of death, but it must, as in the case of your father, be of the very greatest help when one is suddenly called to the other side, and finds oneself at once in known surroundings, sure of one s future, instead of that most unpleasant period of readjustment during which souls have to unlearn what their teachers here have taught and adapt themselves to unfamiliar facts.  A. Conan Doyle.  Crowborough, Sussex, England. September     .                                  Preface    When in April      the {Titanic} sank in mid ocean and my father passed on to the next world, l was on tour with my own Shakespearean Company. Amongst the members of that Company was a young man named Pardoe Woodman, who on the very Sunday of the disaster foretold it as we sat talking after tea.    He did not name the boat or my father, but he got so much that pointed to disaster at sea and the passing on of an elderly man intimately connected with me, that when the sad news came through we realized he must have been closely in touch with what was about to happen.    I mention this incident because it formed the first link between my father and Mr. Woodman, and as it is largely due to Mr. Woodman s psychic powers that my father has been able to get through the messages which are contained in this book, I think, therefore, it will be of interest to readers and should be put on record.    A fortnight after the disaster I saw my father s face and heard his voice just as distinctly as l heard I it when he bade me good bye before embarking on the Titanic.  This was at a sitting with Etta Wriedt, the well known American direct voice medium.    At this sitting, I talked with my father for over twenty minutes.  This may seem an amazing assertion to many, but it is a fact vouched for by all those who were present at the sitting. I put it on record at the time in an article published in {Nash s Magazine}, which included the signed testimonies of all those present.    From that day to this I have been in constant touch with my father. I have had many talks with him and communications from him containing very definite proof of his continued presence amongst us. I can truly say that the link between us is even stronger to day than in     , when he threw off his physical body and passed on the to spirit world. There has never been a feeling of parting, although at first the absence of his physical presence was naturally a source of very great sadness.    In     , Mr. Woodman was invalided out of the Army and came to stay with us at our country cottage at Cobham. Whilst with us, the news came to him that his great friend had been killed at the front, and his interest in the possibility of communication with the next world, which had been indifferent till then, became intense, and he set out to find out for himself. It is ever the passing of a loved one that gives the necessary stimulus for eager inquiry.    It was not long before his friend  was able to give him definite proofs of his continued existence and of his ability to communicate. His first proofs were given through Vout Peters, and were given through Vout Peters, and were followed by others through Gladys Osborne Leonard s mediumship and through the mediumship of friends gifted with psychic powers.    I was present at  that first sitting with Mr. Peters; father was there also, and his friend said it was due to my father s presence and help that he was able to succeed so well in these first attempts at communication. Shortly after this, Mr. Woodman found that he himself had the power of automatic writing, and father and others were soon able to write through him. Father always prefers me to be present, as if I am not he seems to have more difficulty, and very rarely will attempt writing.    He explains the necessity of my presence in this way: he and I are so much {en rapport}, and so closely in touch with each other, that he is able to draw much power from me; I act as the connecting link and form a sort of battery between him and Mr. Woodman. I merely sit passively by whilst Mr. Woodman Writes.    Certainly I see a light around us, and a strong ray of light concentrating on Mr. Woodman s arm. Sometimes I am able to see father himself, and always, when he is writing, I feel his presence very distinctly.    Mr. Woodman also writes with his eyes closed, and often holds a handkerchief over them. Some of the best messages were given in the twilight when it was impossible for me to follow what was being written, and yet the words are were never overwritten. The writing will stop sometimes whilst father evidently reads over what has been written, and alterations will be made, i s dotted and t s crossed correctly.    It was a habit of my father s, whilst here, to go back over his copy and cross his T s and dot his I s; this habit was only known to a few, and was certainly absolutely unknown to Mr. Woodman.    Father s foreword explains his object in writing this book, so there is no need to dwell on that here. When he started, he had a rather longer book in view, but decided in favor of a short book, as it is more likely to be read, can be published at a reasonable price, and so stand the chance of reaching more people. All who worked with my father here will know that such reasoning was characteristic of him.    The photograph given as frontispiece to this volume was taken by the Crewe Circle at Crewe in the autumn of     . ln the spring of that year, I had met Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton at the house of a mutual friend in Glasgow, and they very kindly invited me to call and see them in Crewe if I should ever have an opportunity to do so.    Soon after my return to London father asked me to arrange to go to Crewe, as he said he wanted to try to give us his picture on the same plate with mine. Accordingly I arranged to spend a week end with some friends at Crewe and have some sittings with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton.    I bought a box of plates in London and  took them with me, and I can truthfully say that, that box of plates never left my sight or my possession all the time I was there. I even slept with the box clasped tightly in my hands.    We had our first sitting on the Saturday, when I obtained two extras, neither resembling my father. One was of interest because it was the picture of a lady who had appeared on a plate with my father when he was experimenting with Mr. Boursnell in the  nineties.    I took my box containing the rest of the plates away with me after the sitting; bought another box of plates in Crewe, and took both boxes with me to the sitting on the Sunday. We did not use my first box at all at this sitting, and I kept it all the while just inside my dress.    We sat around the table, putting our hands over and under the second box for a few minutes; I then held the box for a minute against Mrs. Buxton s forehead.    After this I was instructed by Mr. Hope,s guide to take the box myself into the dark room  note the box had not been unsealed or the plates exposed to the light . When in the dark room, I was to unseal the box and take out the two bottom plates, taking particular care to note which was the bottom plate, and then to develop both plates. Mr. Hope was to come in with me, but not to touch box or plates.    I carried out instructions. I found the bottom plate not even fogged, and on the other plate two messages, one from Archdeacon Colley, deploring father s inability to write; one from Mr. Walker, the father of my host, and in one corner of the plate a faint outline of my father s face.    When I got back to my friends that evening, we had a sitting at which father expressed his keen disappointment at his failure to give his picture. {It is all my fault}, he said. {I am so excited at the idea of getting my picture beside yours after I have been so called  dead  for so many years that I break the conditions; however, many have promised to help me tomorrow, and if I fail again we have something else prepared to slip on so that you will not be quite so disappointed.}    On the following morning I went for my last sitting. Two of my own plates were used. On both of these are pictures of my father; one is reproduced in this book, the other is a large face of father which completely covers me.    Now, having, I hope, given a little idea as to how these messages were obtained, and our reasons for feeling that they do indeed come from my father, I am content to let {The Blue Island} do the rest. I am sure it will intrest many, and if it awakens some to a truer realization of what is to come, and makes them seek for further definite proofs to themselves, then the three chiefly concerned in giving these messages to the public   my father, Mr. Woodman and myself   will be amply satisied.                                                        Estelle W. Stead September         We have received many messages in this way. For a while  in      we sat regularly every week, and were kept in touch with much that was going on at the front and of what was about to happen, and were advised of occurrences often days before the news came through in the ordinary way.    In one case father gave us the actual headlines which would and did appear in the papers the following week.    It is interesting also of importance to note that Mr. Woodman and my father met only once before the passing of latter. I introduced Mr. Woodman to him not long before he left England in the {Titanic}, and they only exchanged two or three words.    Therefore, Mr. Woodman never knew my father personally nor has he come into touch with his writings or with his work in any way, and yet the wording and the phrasing of the messages are my father s, and even the manner of writing is typical of him.          A FOREWORD FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD                By William T. Stead THERE is great trepidation on the part of all the uninitiated when first coming into contact with the occult, psychic or unknown forces. In many of life s mysteries there is much pleasure to be had in probing the secret, and the mystery is in itself an incentive to search and to inquire, to overcome the unknown and to gain knowledge on subjects not previously known or proven.    This, however, does not seem to apply when dealing with the mysteries surrounding the after life. There is always a fear of something. Frequently personal, but sometimes fear of harming the individual known and loved on earth. In itself that is a good sign; it argues unselfishness, and consequently the individual who holds off for that reason deserves enlightenment.  If he is sufficiently advanced to seek, he will get enlightenment together with great help.    Again, there are those who, imbued with theosophical ideas, fear to come in contact with what is to their minds the shell of a former loved one, and those who fear through ignorance due to an undeveloped and somewhat uneducated mentality. By that I do not necessarily mean an unschooled mentality. I speak of {uneducated} in the sense of lacking understanding and appreciation of the higher things of life.    To all these people I am, and I always was, most sympathetic. In earth life I did my best to help and enlighten, but I was very restricted owing to material calls upon my time. Since my arrival in this land I have tried to carry on and greatly to increase the amount and the sphere of this same work.    I have succeeded up to a point, though many have not yet reached the half way step on that stair case of knowledge leading to understanding. I was on the point of saying  leading to happiness , but that would not be quite correct, for happiness is most amply contained in  understanding , and happiness in the sense that it is used and understood on earth is {not} the {raison d etre} of life.    We were not made only to be happy. Happiness is part of our reward for work done, for progress and for help given to others   which is itself the outcome of understanding.    As I have said, in my work on this side of the Borderland I have achieved a certain success, and I am confident that if I can pass on the knowledge I have gained, together with my own personal experiences, to you who are still on earth, I shall have gone a little farther in the work to which I have set my hand for the good of humanity.    What I have to tell will be of interest to many, and will be useless to many more, but I am going to tell of things which each one of my readers can, up to a point, test for himself. You can each one of you test it by soul knowledge, and by that you will know that I am giving you words of value, words which God in His infinite love has permitted me to be the means of passing to you. It is not {my} idea of the mysteries of life, it is a discourse on those mysteries.    There is the teaching of Christianity running all through, but the application is different to that ordinarily accepted. It is quite erroneous to suppose that because a man was a man on earth, he will become a spirit angle the moment he dies.    Death is only the doorway from one room to another, and both rooms are very similarly furnished and arranged. That s what I want you to appreciate thoroughly; it is under the same guiding hand. The same Personality rules all spheres.    Beginning at the beginning, I have to tell you how a man finds himself here on arrival. As I have said, this whole book will interest many and help a few. It is for that few that all concerned are making the necessary effort to bring it to them. It does not attempt or pretend to be on scientific lines. All through, you can apply sound common sense, and you cannot break down what is.    I have dealt with the subject very briefly, only for the reason that many will read a short, concise account who would not study a detailed one.   I must impress upon you all   the interested and the disinterested, the believer in this great subject, Spiritualism, and the skeptic   to remember you are still on earth and you have still to perform earth s duties. You have your daily lives to lead and you must always do well the work in hand.    Never neglect the present because the future appears more brightly colored. Carry on with today, but with a corner of your mind on to morrow, and remember also that phenomenal Spiritualism is {not} for all.    Many minds could not absorb the greatness of the subject together with the facts of the phenomena and still continue in their routine in normal manner   these are the people for whom phenomena Spiritualism is not. They will be wise to go no further into the subject than knowledge gained from books and from the experiences of others. In this sense, Spiritualism is not for all.                                  William T. Stead.                  THE BLUE ISLAND             Communicated By W.T. Stead,           through the hand of Estell Stead       Experience of a New Arrival Beyond the Veil                        CHAPTER I    Many years ago I was attracted by an article on the subject of spirit communication, and, after reading it carefully several times, I was forced to admit its soundness. I was struck by the plain and practical ideas of the writer. This was the first cause of my becoming actively interested in this big and amazing work. From that time onward I did all in my power to prove and then forward the movement.    Many people know this; and those who do not, can become acquainted with the details if they wish.  Therefore I am going to pass at once from my first earth interest in the occult to my first interest in the earth.    Just as I was overcome with astonishment and satisfaction on first reaching conviction on earth, so I was astonished almost equally on my coming to this land and finding that my knowledge of this subject gained on earth was strikingly correct in nearly all the chief points.    There was a great satisfaction in proving this. I was at once amazed and delighted to find so much truth in all I had learned; for although I had believed implicitly, I was not entirely without grave misgivings upon many minor details. Hence my general satisfaction when I recognized things and features which, though I had accepted whilst on earth, I had scarcely anticipated would be as I now found them.    This must sound somewhat contradictory, but I want you to understand that my earthly misgivings were based on fear that perhaps the spirit world had a formula of its own which was quite different from our earthly mentality, and that, therefore, the many points were transmitted to us in such a form and in such expression as we on earth would be able to grasp and appreciate, and were not in themselves the precise descriptions, owing to the limitations of earth word expression.    Of my actual passing from earth to spirit life, I do not wish to write more than a few lines. I have already spoken of it several times and in several places. The first part of it was naturally an extremely discordant one, but from the time my physical life was ended there was no longer that sense of struggling with overwhelming odds; but I do not wish to speak of that.    My first surprise came when   I now understand that to your way of thinking I was dead   I found I was in a position to help people. From being in dire straights myself, to being able to lend a hand to others, was such a sudden transition that I was frankly and blankly surprised.    I was so taken aback that I did not consider the why and the wherefore at all. I was suddenly able to help.  I knew not how or why and did not attempt to inquire.  There was no analysis then; that came a little later.    I was also surprised to find a number of friends with me, people I knew had passed over years before.  That was the first cause of my realizing the change had taken place. I knew it suddenly and was a trifle alarmed. Practically instantaneously I found myself looking for myself. Just a moment of agitation, momentary only, and then the full and glorious realization that all I had learned was true.    Oh, how badly I needed a telephone at that moment I felt I could give the papers some headlines for the evening. That was my first realization; then came a helplessness   a reaction   a thought of all my own at home   they didn t know yet. What would they think of me? Here was I, with my telephone out of working order for the present. I was still so near to the earth that I could see everything going on there.    Where I was I could see the wrecked ship, the people, the whole scene; and that seemed to pull me into action   I could help . . . And so in a few seconds   though I am now taking a long time to tell you, it was only a few seconds really   I found myself changed from the helpless state to one of action; {helpful} not helpless   was helpful, too, I think.    I pass a little now. The end came and it was all finished with. It was like waiting for a liner to sail; we waited until all were aboard. I mean we waited until the disaster was complete. The saved   saved; the dead   alive. Then in one whole we moved our scene.    It was a strange method of travelling for us all, and we were a strange crew, bound for we knew not where. The whole scene was indescribably pathetic.  Many, knowing what had occurred, were in agony of doubt as to their people left behind and as to their own future state. What would it hold for them? Would they be taken to see HIM? What would their sentence be?    Others were almost mental wrecks. They knew nothing, they seemed to be uninterested in everything, their minds were paralyzed. A strange crew indeed, of human souls waiting their ratings in the new land.    A matter of a few minutes in time only, and here were hundreds of bodies floating in the water   dead   hundreds of souls carried through the air, alive; very much alive, some were. Many, realizing their death had come, were enraged at their own powerlessness to save their valuables. They fought to save what they had on earth prized so much.    The scene on the boat at the time of the striking was not so pleasant, but it was as nothing to the scene among the poor souls newly thrust out of their bodies, all unwillingly. It was both heartbreaking and repellant. And thus we waited   waited until all were collected, until all were ready, and then we moved our scene to a different land.    It was a curious journey that. Far more strange than anything I had anticipated. We seemed to rise vertically into the air at terrific speed. As a whole we moved, as if we were on a very large platform, and this was hurled into the air with gigantic strength and speed, yet there was no feeling of insecurity ... We were quite steady.    I cannot tell how long our journey lasted, nor how far from the earth we were when we arrived, but it was a gloriously beautiful arrival. It was like walking from your own Indian Sky. There, all was brightness and beauty.    We saw this land far off when we were approaching, and those of us who could understand realized that we were being taken to the place destined for all those people who pass over suddenly   on account of its general appeal. It helps the nerve racked newcomer to fall into line and regain mental balance very quickly.    We arrived feeling, in a sense, proud of ourselves.  It was all lightness, brightness. Everything as physical and quite as material in every way as the world we had just finished with.    Our arrival was greeted with welcomes from many old friends and relations who had been dear to each one of us in our earth life. And having arrived, we people who had come over from that ill fated ship parted company.  We were free agents again, though each one of us was in the company of some personal friends who had been over here a long while.                  The Blue Island                     CHAPTER II    I have told you a little about the journey and arrival, and I want now to tell you my first impression and a few experiences. I must begin by saying I do not know how long after the collision these experiences took place. It seemed to be a continuation without any break, but I cannot be certain that this was so.    I found myself in company with two old friends, one of them my father. He came to be with me, to help and generally show me round. It was like nothing else so much as merely arriving in a foreign country and having a chum to go around with. That was the principal sensation. The scene from which we had so lately come was already well relegated to the past.    Having accepted the change of death, all the horror of our late experience had gone. It might have been fifty years ago instead of, perhaps, only last night.  Consequently our pleasure in the new land was not marred by grief at being parted from earth friends. I will not say that none were unhappy, many were; but that was because they did not understand the nearness of the two worlds; they did not know what was possible, but to those who understood the possibilities, it was in a sense the feeling, {Let us enjoy a little of this new land before mailing our news home}; therefore there was little grief in our arrival.    In writing my first experiences I am going to give a certain amount of detail. My old sense of humor is still with me, I am glad to say, and I know that what I have to say now will cause a certain amount of amusement to those who treat this subject lightly, but that I do not mind.    I am glad they will find something to smile at   it will make an impression on them that way, and then when their own time comes for the change they will recognize themselves amongst the conditions of which I am going to write. Therefore to that kind of skeptic I just say, {It s all right, friend,} and, {You give no offense.}    My father and I, with my friend also, set out immediately. A curious thing struck me. I was clothed exactly as I had been, and it seemed a little strange to me to think I had brought my clothing with me... {There s number one, Mr. Skeptic}    My father was also dressed as I had always known him. Everything and everybody appeared to be quite normal   quite as on earth. We went out together and had refreshment at once, and naturally, that was followed by much discussion about our mutual friends on both sides. I was able to give them news and they gave me information about our friends and also about the conditions ruling in this new country.    Another thing which struck me was the general coloring of the place; of England it would be difficult to say what the impression of coloring is, but I suppose it would be considered grey green. Here there was no uncertainty about the impression; it is undoubtedly a blue which predominated. A light shade of blue. I do not mean the people, trees, houses, etc., were all {Blue}; but the general impression was that of a {blue land.}    I commented upon this to my father   who, by the way, was considerably more active and younger than he was at time of death; we looked more like brothers. I spoke of this impression of blue, and he explained that it was so in a sense. There was a great predominance of blue rays in the light, and that was why it was so wonderful a place for mental recovery. Now some say, {How completely foolish...}    Well, have you not on earth certain places considered especially good for this or that ailment? . . . Then bring common sense to bear, and realize that the next step after death is only a very little one.  You do not go from indifferent manhood to perfect godliness! It is not like that; it is all progress and evolution, and as with people, so with lands. The next world is only a complement of your present one.    We were a quaint population in that country. There were People of all conditions, of all colors, all races and all sizes: all went about freely together, but there was a great sense of caring only for oneself   self absorption. A bad thing on earth, but a necessary thing here, both for the general and individual good.  There would be no progress or recovery in this land without it.    As a result of this absorption there was a general peace amongst these many people, and this peace would not have been attained without this self centeredness.  No one took notice of any other. Each stood for himself, and was almost unaware of all the others.    There were not many people whom I knew. Most of those who came to meet me had disappeared again, and I saw scarcely any I knew, except my two companions. I was not sorry for this. It gave me more chance of appreciating all this new scene before me. There was the sea where we were, and I and my companions went for a long walk together along the shore.    It was not like one of your seaside resorts, with promenade and band; it was a peaceful and lovely spot.  There were some very big buildings on our right, and on our left was the sea. All was light and bright, and again this blue atmosphere was very marked. I do not know how far we went, but we talked incessantly of our new conditions and of my own folk at home and of the possibility of letting them know how it fared with me, and I think we must have gone a long way.    If you can imagine what your world would look like if it were compressed into a place, say, the size of England   with some of all people, all climates, all scenery, all buildings, all animals   then you can, perhaps, form an idea of this place I was in. It must all sound very unreal and dreamlike, but, believe me, it was only like being in a foreign country and nothing else, except that it was absorbingly interesting.    I want to give you a picture of this new land without going too deeply into the minute details. We arrived at length at a huge building, circular and with a great dome. Its general appearance was of a dome only   on legs   I mean a great dome supported on vast columns, circular and very big. This again, in the interior, was an amazingly lovely blue.    It was not a fantastic structure in any way. It was just a beautiful building, as you have on earth   do not imagine anything fairylike; it was not. This blue was again very predominant, and it gave me a feeling of energy. I wanted immediately to write. I would like to have been a poet at that moment, but as it was I just wanted to express myself with pen and ink.    We stayed there some time and had refreshment very similar, it seemed to me, to what I had always known, only there was no fresh food. Everything appeared quite normal there, too, and the absence of some things which would on earth have been present was not noticed.    The curious thing was that the meal did not seem at all a necessity   it was there , and we all partook of it lightly, but it was more from habit than need   I seemed to draw much more strength and energy out of the atmosphere itself. This I attributed to the color and air. It was while we were in this place that my father explained the reason and work of the different buildings I had noted on our walk together.        RNet  .  R:ILink:After Five BBS * Elkhart,IN *                               Interesting Buildings CHAPTER III    LOOKED upon as a meal   a lunch out   it was the longest one I have ever known and without question the most interesting. I learnt a great deal in those first few hours with my father. It was all conversational, but it was of great use to me and of vast interest. He explained to me that the place we were then in was a temporary rest house, one of many, but the one most used by newly arrived spirit people. It was nearest to earth conditions and was used because it resembled an earth place in appearance. There were other buildings used for the same purpose as well as for other purposes; by that I mean there is more than one of each.    These houses were not all alike, they varied considerably in outward appearance, but there is no need to describe each. To call it a big building is sufficient, and by that you must understand a place like your museum or your portrait gallery, or your large hotels . . . anything you like, and it is near enough. But it was not fantastic in any way and had no peculiarities, therefore by { building  I mean a} building only.    There were a great number of these places in different parts   not grouped together, but variously placed about this land.    It seemed that all the senses are provided for here.  The chief work on this island is to get rid of unhappiness at parting from earth ties, and therefore, for the time being, the individual is allowed to indulge in most of earth s pleasures. There are attractions of all kinds to stimulate and generally to tone up strength.    Whatever the person s particular interest on earth has been, he can follow it up and indulge in it here also for the present. All mental interests and almost all physical interests can be continued here, for that one reason of coaxing the newcomer to a level mental outlook.    There are houses given over to book study, music, to athleticism of all kinds. Every kind of physical game be practiced   you can ride on horseback, you can swim in the sea. You can have all and any kind of sport which does not involve the taking of life. In a minor degree that can be had too, but not in reality; that is only make believe.    From this you will understand that particular buildings are given over to their own kind of work. The man who has spent his life in games, heart and soul, would be disconsolate without them here . . . he can have them and enjoy them to the full; but he will find that after a time the desire is not so keen and he will turn to other interests automatically, though gradually, and it may be that he will never entirely abandon his games, but the desire will be less absorbing.    On the other hand, the man who used his life for, say, music, for instance, will find his desire, his interest, and his ability increasing by leaps and bounds   because music belongs to this land. He will find that by spending much time in one of the music houses, as he {will} if his life is music, his knowledge and ability are amazingly increased. Then there is the bookworm. He, too, finds intense satisfaction in his new found facilities. Knowledge is unlimited   works of priceless value, lost upon earth, are in existence here. He is provided for.    The keen business man on earth whose only interest is in making his business successful will also find scope for ability. He will come in contact with the house of organization, and he will find himself linked up with work transcending in interest anything that he could have imagined for himself whilst upon earth.    Now all this is done for a reason. Everyone is provided for. On arriving here there is often much grief; grief that is sometimes incapacitating, and no movement forward can be made until the individual wishes it himself. Progress cannot be forced upon him.    Thus in the scheme of creation the blessed Creator has devised this wonderful means of appealing to the main interest on earth of each one. Everyone comes in touch with the chief longing of earth life, and is given opportunity to indulge in it, thus progress ms assured.    In all things that are purely and solely of the earth, the interest flags after a little time; a gradual process  nothing is dramatic here  and the person passes from this to another interest which on earth would be called a mental one. Those whose interests have been in this mind category will continue and enlarge the scope of their work, and will progress along the same lines   the others change.    Whilst in this {Blue Island} each one is very much in touch with the conditions left behind. At first there is nothing done but what is both helpful and comforting   later there is a refining process to be gone through. At first it is possible to be closely in touch with the home left behind, but after a little time, there is a reaction from this desire to be so close to earth, and when that sets in the process of eliminating earth, and flesh instincts begins. In each case this takes a different course, a different length of time.    In trying thus to explain the use of this land and its buildings, I have not numbered them { Building A } for so and so, { Building B } for this, that and the other, but, in a conversational way, I hope I have helped you to understand and form a general idea of this country and some of its conditions. I hope I have made it clear now, after a time, the desire for earth things leaves us all. It may be a short or long time, according to the disposition of the person concerned.    Take the athlete. He loves his games, his running, his physical strength and his muscular exercise. Well, he will love it here as much. He will love it here more, because he will find an added pleasure in feeling no fatigue, a sharpened enjoyment altogether, but after a time his appreciation of all this will change. He will not dislike this hitherto loved sport, but he will pass to a different form of it; a form which is full of movement and satisfaction but not a physical affair at all; his mind will become more awake, and he will get enormous mental satisfaction from the studies which will come before him concerning the ways and means of travel here.    Locomotion of all kinds here is very different to that which obtains in earth conditions, and this former athlete of earth will drop into line in his new surroundings and will presently realize that life here is a different thing for him, for, though still on the same lines, it holds an increased mental interest. Is that clear? . . . Well, apply it in the same fashion to every other type of individual.  everything in TILDES was originally in ITALICS                      Life on the Island CHAPTER IV    HAVING given you a little idea of this land and its appearance, I want to tell you about the life of the people here, so that you can form a mental picture in completeness. It is only natural that many should say, {What are they all doing?} Now, this is a very broad question to answer, and to help you to see how big a thing I am dealing with in thus attempting to give my story of the next life I must put a simple question to you.    I want you to try to imagine you have not been living on earth and that, knowing nothing of earth life, you have suddenly been landed by an airship in the busiest part of the city of London   with all its traffic and its people. You have arrived from some other world and have not seen this sight before. You will exclaim, {How strange... What are they all doing?}    Well, could you answer that question easily? It would not mean much to you to be told they are going about their own individual business   one man bakes bread, another sweeps the streets, another drives a cart, and another sits in an office and runs a business   all that would leave you none the wiser.    These are facts, and yet you would not understand them. You could not comprehend them. That is my difficulty in trying to make you understand in a satisfactory way the life of this Blue Isle. I have to consider how to explain it. It is no use my telling you that one person sits by the sea all the time, weeping because of her parting from her lover, and another is in a mental stupor for drink, and another still thinks he is ringing the bells of his local chapel on Sunday, etc., etc.   that is not the life, those are only bits of it. Atoms of the whole.    I do not want to particularize, I want to generalize, with some detail. Therefore I must say that if you were to pay this land a visit in your earth bodies, as you are at present, you would be struck by the lack of excitement. You would think it all so like earth. That is what you would say to people on your return. {Oh, it s so much like our life here, only there are a lot of different races of mankind there.}    Everyday life for the individual is strikingly like the everyday life he s always been used to. At first he takes a great deal of rest, having the earth habit of sleep   and it is a necessity   he needs sleep here, too, for the present. We have no night as you have, but he sleeps and rests just the same. He has his interests in visiting different parts, in exploring the land and its building and in studying its animal and vegetable life. He has friends to seek out and to see. He has his pastimes to indulge. He has his new found desire for knowledge to feed.    The routine of a day here is similar to the routine of a day on earth; the difference being that earth s routine is often made by force of circumstance, whereas, here it is made according to desire for knowledge on this or that subject.    In clothing, we are all practically as on earth, and as there are so many races here you can well understand the general appearance of this land is most unusual, and in an odd way particularly interesting and amusing, also instructive. I think I have said that in general appearance we all are as we all were. We are only a very little way from earth, and consequently up to this time we have not thrown off earth ideas. We have gained some new ones, but have as yet discarded few or none.     The process of discarding is a gradual one. As we live here we gain knowledge of many kinds, and come to find so many things, hitherto thought essential, not only of no importance but something of a bore, a nuisance, and that is how we grow to a state of dropping all earth habits. We get to the state of not desiring a smoke, not because we can t have it, or think it not right, but because the desire for it is not there.    As with a smoke, so with food, so with many a dozen things; we are just as satisfied without them. We do not miss them; if we did we should have them, and we do have them until the desire is no longer there.    At first there is practical freedom of thought and action, and there are only certain limitations imposed   not by rule but by conditions. Beyond these limitations there is absolute freedom. After a time, when the spirit has advanced to the point of desiring knowledge and enlightenment, he will be drawn like a piece of steel to a magnet, into contact with this or that house of organization dealing with the subject on which he desires knowledge.    From the time of coming into touch with this house the spirit will be, as it were, {at school.} He will perforce have to attend this house of instruction. He will spend a good deal of his time there learning, and, when finished with one house, will pass to another, but it is not compulsory information, it is craved for information, and nothing is given until asked for.    You are not forced to acquire {anything.} You are more than ever free agents. That is why on earth it is so essential to control your bodies by your minds, and not the reverse. When you come here your mind is all powerful, and everything depends, for your own degree of happiness here, upon the kind of mind you bring with you.    The presence or absence of contentment is entirely due to the earth life you have led, the character formed, opportunities taken and lost, the motive of and for your actions, the help given, the manner of help received, your mental outlook and your use and abuse of flesh power.    To sum all these up it is the quality of mind control over body {versus} body over mind. Mind matters and body matters; it is in your keeping entirely and is in whatever state you have made it by your life. On your arrival here the degree of your happiness will be determined automatically by the demands of your mind.    When you are inclined to ask, {What are they all doing there?} turn your mind to some dear one on earth who has taken up an out of the way kind of life somewhere abroad, where you are not in constant and intimate touch, and say of him, {I wonder what he s doing now?} . . . Then answer it yourself by saying {I suppose he s carrying on.} So are we, we people in the {blue Island.}                        Intimate Life CHAPTER V    There is a good deal of reasoning and argument as to why in earth life we should do this or that. Why we should refrain from many of the delights of everyday life and why we should {go straight.}    People say it is handicapping in their business or their profession to have to observe these {nice points.} They may not confess this thought openly, but to themselves they do   they do not see why such and such should not be done. True, they think it may injure so and so s business a little, but that is his affair.    {All in ignorance.}    There is a reason, and that reason can be very easily found by the rule of common sense. I almost might call this a discourse upon cause and effect.    Earth life has deteriorated. The whole scheme of creation is planned with great precision, with the object of allowing free individual development and progress. Its rules are laid down clearly. Every man knows by instinct when he is obeying and when disobeying these rules.    It needs no police officer to tell him. He may deceive himself that such an act is all that it should be, but at the same time he knows in his own consciousness that, that act or thought is not only {not} all that it should be but that it is all that it ought {not} to be. I say that all mankind knows   but most of mankind prefers to think it does not know.    Not one person on earth can stand up and say I am not speaking a profound truth here!    Mostly these things are not considered from the point of right or wrong, but from the view, {Shall I benefit by this?}   but I say that all people on earth {can} discriminate, I do not say that they do, between good and not good motive in their lives. Instinct does this for them. They cannot help themselves. They are bound to know.    The trouble is that the vast majority by force of habit, the desire for business gain, or social gain, or any kind of gain, but always a gain for itself, has ceased to consider the quality of its actions and thinks only of the first result. It is a pity. It is more than that, Looked upon from the next stage in evolution it is {Pitiful.} Poor undeveloped egos, preparing their own discomfort and suffering   not a hell fire but a mental torture.    The self or spirit of a man is encased in his mind, and, examined in a purely physical way, the brain is the most baffling organ of the body scientific man ever had to deal with. Much can be understood; all never will be. Judged as being the casing and instrument of the soul it becomes an even more delicate and intricate and baffling piece of work. You all know that mind is the generating house for all your acts and deeds, but you do not fully appreciate the fact that every act and every thought is {booked}   is recorded.    You do not see the elaborate scheme of work which goes on in any of your large business houses, when you buy something and do not pay at once. It is booked and passes through many hands before the bill is sent to you a little later, and having paid the bill you forget it all, but the record of that business house has it still. So with the brain; an act or a thought, no matter what the quality, is recorded for all time.    Settling will come after life, and when paid the {book} is finished with and troubles no more, though the record is still there. Now follow me. Mind and its work   thought   is the force that drives and creates everything on earth. It has all to be mental before physical or material. That you all know. Every building was conceived mentally before being built.    Thought is divided in itself into different types.  There is the thought of your next meal which is of no particular interest, and there are the thoughts constructive and destructive. These are important.  There are the purely personal thoughts. Sometimes advantageous and sometimes the reverse.    Now, the all important forms of thought are the constructive and destructive. The others referring to your meals, your clothes, your appearance, your anything you like, these are not of importance until they are allowed to hinder the flow of constructive thought; when they do this the character of these same thoughts changes and becomes {destructive.}    It is the material embodiment of destructive thought which causes most of the distress and misery in the world. The sum total goes on increasing, and will continue to increase, until mankind as a whole, and individually, will listen and try to understand a little more about himself beyond what is necessary for him to know for the selling of his goods, and thus give fuller play to the beneficent action of constructive thought which alone can redeem and save the world.             More About Intimate Life CHAPTER VI    TO a great extent the individual hardships of earth life are directly due to wrong thinking. I am fully aware that people are placed in many different positions right from birth. Some inherit unhappiness and difficulty from their parents, and their lot in life is harder and their pleasures are less than in the lives of those who are born in better conditions.    Accepting these differences of position and condition   one man a life of much hard work, another a comfortable and perhaps rather idle life   the same rule of thought applies. The man who has grown up under hard conditions is by circumstances forced into a groove of thought   a regular rut. He cannot help himself because there are no real attempts made by amy to change his outlook; he may meet with material help from time to time, but he meets with little practical mental assistance. He is under the disadvantage of his lifelong earth conditions, and is in ignorance because he does not understand and has little opportunity for learning about these things; by his thought he adds to his difficulties instead of easing and finally removing many of them.    The other man, who is comfortably settled and has no particular worries, does precisely the same thing. He trudges along in the same mental rut  stagnation, {Mental Stagnation,} and the same results will fall to them both hereafter. They are both building up their future states.    Then there are people of keen intelligence, clever people, who use their brains to achieve material gain no matter the cost to others. These people are indulging in the most positive form of destructive thought. They are not like the other two   negative.  They are very alive, alert and positive. They are at once using destructive and constructive thought.    The latter is entirely misapplied, and when they come here the account against them will be much heavier, because they will have built up a wall of greedy thought which themselves have originally sent out and which they must settle in this next condition.    A thought   no matter the heading it comes under   that has come into your mind and which you have sent out, is an accomplished thing so far as your {mind} goes. Your physical act may or may not keep swift accompaniment with the thought; that does not matter from the point of view of what you are building up for yourself {here.}    Once having had his thought it is {done,} so far as your mind is concerned, and, whether you follow it up actively or not, you have to make repayment for it when you come here. I am not speaking about the thousand trivial thoughts of every hour, but about those which I might describe as having personality.    You will say it is impossible to control every thought of the day, and I agree that it is, but if once you accepted for fact what I have said you would keep a sharp eye on your mental actions. They matter. You will find this very difficult to accept because it is indeed an intimate thing for each one; you do not know each other s thoughts whilst upon earth, therefore I have headed this chapter {Intimate Life.}    Each of you will live to thank the person who is responsible for giving you this information if you act upon it, and those of you who hear and know but do not act upon the knowledge, will have one day to cast reproaches upon yourselves for this failure.    To realize oneself that one has failed is far more bitter than the consciousness that others know it.    Think upon this and reason a little with your own inner self.                     First Attempts CHAPTER VII    Leaving the question of time out of it entirely, as I must, I want to write of my first attempt to communicate with the earth world. I know there is much dissatisfaction with the spirit world on account of the practical impossibility to give correct ideas of time spacing. I would like to say a little about that before going into the main interest of today s writing. You must not be over hasty in condemning us for this failure.    On earth you all space your time by days and hours, etc., but those spacings are also based, or perhaps more definitely marked in your mental reckoning, on the habits of the day. You have always taken certain things at certain hours. You have a light sky and a dark sky; without a watch you know fairly accurately the time of day by your inclinations   fatigue or freshness, the need for food or rest, etc., etc.    Now, on this side of the grave we have no real necessity for rest or for food. We have no dark sky   only a light one, and we have, for the sake of the present illustration, an unlimited supply of energy. Consequently we are not able to break up time into spaces which correspond with earth spacings.    We do break up our time, but it is not {your} breaking, therefore we can seldom be accurate in telling when a thing did, or when a thing will, happen.    For that reason I am not able to tell how long I had been in this country before I made my first attempt to link up with earth again. To me I seemed to have lived in this land always.    It appeared incredible to me that it could be only a few days since I arrived. I had not forgotten my family or my friends, but I felt peculiarly happy about them.  I cannot think why, except that finding my earth knowledge so very correct I gathered strength in feeling that they too would understand everything was quite well with me, and that this little delay in writing was natural considering the new country I had come to.    The house which is given over to this work in the {Blue Island} had been a regular haunting place of mine ever since my father had told me of it, together with the works of the other buildings. I went to this house a great deal, and received much help from the various people in charge. They were all very sympathetic, but entirely business like.    It was not merely a house of tears and sympathy, it was an amazingly well organized and business like place. There were many hundreds of people there. Those who had on earth believed and those who had not, came to try to wire a message home.    The heart call was the one which received the most serious attention. Many were there only as lookers on, incredulous and facetious. They got nothing more than the satisfaction of their own amazement.    {After a little time my turn came.}    For a building given over to this kind of work it appeared to be inadequately equipped. I had rather expected to see many implements and instruments, many wires and machines, and the presence of electric forces, but there was nothing of that kind at all. It was all and only the human element.    I had a long conversation with a man there   a man obviously of some importance, though I cannot say he looked like an angel; he appeared quite as mundane as myself. I had a long talk with him, and from him heard how a great deal of this work was carried on. He told me they had a system of travelers, whose work was very close to physical earth. They had the power of sensing people who could and would be used for this work at the other end.    These men could locate and then tabulate the earth people, marking each individual ability, and when the newly arrived spirit came in search of help, these sensitives on earth were used as each could be used.  This is a sketchy outline of the work done in that building ... There I came frequently and tried to get my messages through to home by more than one means; I succeeded in some ways, I failed in others. The spirit has much to do himself with the success or failure attained; a great deal depends upon him.    Every time I succeeded I helped another. Ever time I failed went for help, and got it. Having given much time and study to the subject on earth, I was given unlimited assistance at this end of the line now that I needed it.    I want to explain how I got some of my first messages through and how I knew I had succeeded. We had been taught by this time how to come in close contact with the earth, although it was not possible for me to do this alone. I had a helper with me. I must call him an official. He came with me to my first trial.    We came into a room, which seemed to have walls made of muslin  something and yet nothing. I know it was a house, and was conscious of the walls of the room, and yet they seemed such poor things because we could see through them and move through them. I could not have done this by myself at that time, but with my official we did.    Then came the attempt. There were two or three people in this room, and they were all talking together about the horror of this great disaster and about the probability of people coming back. They were holding a seance, and my official showed we how to make my presence known.    The controlling force, he told me, was thought. I had to visualize myself among these people in the flesh. Imagine I was standing there in the flesh, in the center of them, and then imagine myself still there with a strong light thrown upon me. . . . Create the picture. Hold the visualization very deliberately and in detail, and keep it fixed upon my mind, that at that moment I {was} there and that they were conscious of it. I failed, of course, at first, but I know that after a few attempts I succeeded and those people did actually see me.    My face only, but that was because in my picture I had seen myself only as a face. I imagined the part they would recognize me by. I was also able to get a message in the same way. Precisely the same way. I stood by the most sensitive present, and spoke and concentrated my mind on a short sentence, and repeated it with much emphasis and deliberation until I could hear part of it spoken by this person. I knew that at last I had succeeded, and I succeeded reasonably easily because I knew so intimately what the conditions of those people and that earth room were. Many who had not my earth knowledge made little impression at all.    There was none of my own family present that time.  Had there been it would have made it impossible for me, as I was then feeling their sorrow acutely, and I would not have been able to give my mind so full a power as I did   I became almost impersonal. It was a good thing that my first attempt was purely a test one   to see if I could break through to home.             Reality of Though Communication CHAPTER VIII    In trying to establish a definite form of communication between the earth sphere and the Blue Island, people are always looking for the return of the physical part of the individual. They find it exceedingly difficult to accept even the most pressing mental tests as being proof of communication; and in giving so much attention to this physical form, they nearly overlook the form of thought communication, which is much more personal and very much less tainted by outside influence, such as the medium s mind, or other sitters . . . antagonism, or bias either way. This thought communication is a much more real form than is accepted by the majority of believers in the possibility of it.    In concentrating the mind on any one spirit person, you are sending out real, live, active forces. These forces pass through the air in precisely the same way as electric waves do, and they never miss their mark.  You concentrate on Mr. A in the spirit world, and immediately Mr. A is conscious of a force coming to him    In this land we are much more sensitive than whilst on earth, and when thoughts are directed to us by people on your side, we have a direct call from those currents of thought thus generated, and we are practically always able to come in close contact with the person who is thinking of us; when near and acclimatized to his conditions we can impress thoughts and ideas upon his mind. He will seldom accept them for what they are, but will think they are his own normal thoughts or something of an hallucination.    Nevertheless, if frequent opportunity is given he will be startled at the amount of information he can record. This applies to everyone, not merely to the believer in these subjects. Anyone who sits for a moment and allows his mind to dwell on some dear one who had {died} will actually draw the spirit of that persons to himself. He may be conscious or unconscious of the presence, but the presence is there.    If people on earth realized the result of their thoughts upon those to whom they refer, they would be very much more careful in giving their mind free play.  There are so many thoughts possible, and all of them are registered here; many of them affect the people they concern, but all of them affect the people from whom they emanate.    Perhaps in telling you all thoughts are recorded I am making it more difficult for you to accept and understand. It will be better, therefore, to explain that by {all thoughts} I refer only to all {direct} thoughts. In reality every thought is registered; the personal ones are, as I have previously said, of no importance so long as they are not allowed to grow into destructive thoughts.    In speaking of direct thought I mean you to understand {positive} thoughts, about other people, pleasant or unpleasant, and not the thoughts of every day trivialities.    Many people find it impossible to believe that every direct thought they have is registered, or that it can in any way influence or affect the person concerned, or return to influence themselves, but this is so.    You are fully aware of the influence given out by any one person who is deeply depressed or more than usually excited and happy. Each of you has felt this influence. This is, of course, caused by the lowered or raised mental vibrations, giving out particularly strong currents of either depression or happiness.    They are equally strong currents in themselves although they act differently upon the people with whom they come into contact. It is in this way that all direct thoughts act. Frequently the subject is not conscious of these thoughts upon himself, but influence is there in a subtle and greater or lesser degree of strength, and all these thoughts are very definitely registered in the mind of the thinker long after the incident itself has passed.    When coming to this land, that whole record has to be dealt with. Not by a judge in wig and gown, but by our own spirit selves. In spirit life we have a full and clear remembrance of all these things and, according to quality of these individual thoughts, so we are brought into a state of regret, happiness or unhappiness, despair or satisfaction.    It is here that we meet with the desire to make return, to put right all the discomfort and distress, minor or major, as it may be, caused by thoughtless mind action whilst on earth.    This is why I say that whilst on earth it is not only advisable, but essential to keep your minds under control and in order. It is only wisdom so to do. The difficulty is that people will not realize this whilst upon earth, although they know from their own inner consciousness that I am stating a truth.    I want you all to try to realize the results you are making, the unhappiness you are causing others, and the regret and sorrow you are laying up for yourselves in the next world when you have to face the conditions you have made. Remember that your minds are the generating houses. You are building up whatever is to be your next condition, precisely and exactly by the lives you are leading on earth, by your thoughts and by the degree to which your body controls your mind instead of your mind ruling supreme.    So long as you are upon earth you are Body  Physical  and Soul  Mind  and Spirit  Self . When you come here you are Mind  Soul  and Self  Spirit  only. Therefore for your own future happiness it is essential that your Mind should rule during earth life. It is for you to say whether it shall do so. If you are willing to pay your bill when you come over, carry on as you are, but there is no further credit given; you have to settle it here. If you are a quarter as practical as you each and all think you are, you will see to it that the mind leads.    It can lead very delightfully, although you may think it leads only to religious restriction   it does not only lead there; it leads to all earth s pleasures, all earth s enjoyments, but it always holds the ruling hand, and can stop at the right time, whereas the body cannot, and so it runs up debts which have to be paid, and paid sometimes very dearly and bitterly.    Earth was made beautiful for Man to enjoy   not merely to tantalize him   lead him on and then say, {No } That is not the way of our blessed Creator. He has given beauty and the faculty for enjoying beauty to all mankind, and so long as the mind rules it will continue to be beauty, but when only the body rules, influencing and degrading the mind as it will, then trouble lies ahead; much trouble and much acute regret.    When we are here our minds work in the same manner, they obey the same rules, and the presence or absence of body does not hinder our thinking powers, and consequently there is no difficulty in coming into touch with some of our people left behind and being in close touch with them, influencing them greatly; although many of them are unconscious of it.    I want you to think of this and to realize that your own people can come to you, that thought is all powerful and that you can build up or destroy, help or hinder, draw near you, or drive away from you, the people incarnate and discarnate, who were and who are so dear to each of you by this power of thought.    Thought communication is the closest link between the two worlds, but it must be well ordered and well trained brain action. You must not imagine that every idea which enters your mind is put there by a spirit person; it is not so at all, but at the same time, if you train your mind in the way an athlete trains his body, you can then ask for and receive great knowledge and much help, both spiritual and material.                   Important Points CHAPTER IX    A SUBJECT of this importance and interest is full of queries. Each one has his own questions to put, and each brings what he considers a hitherto unnoticed point. I want, if possible, to answer a few of these constantly recurring queries now. I had many put to me during my investigations whilst on earth, and some of them I can answer at last. I want you first to realize that by the change of death you {do not} become part of the Godhead {Immediately.}    The mysteries of life of life are not revealed to you as a kind of welcoming gift on your arrival here.  You must not think that I, or any, have {full} knowledge on all subjects, profound and trivial, the moment we come to spirit life . . . I cannot tell you when your grandson will next require new shoes . . .  nor can I tell you the settlement of the Irish question.    I can only see a little farther than you, and I do not by any means possess the key to the door of All Knowledge and All Truth. That, we have each to work for . . . and as we pass through one door we find another in front of us to be unlocked ... and another and another.    But, on the other hand, remember that I do know considerably more than you do, because I am in more intimate touch with the Main Source of knowledge, and I have passed through an experience which is still ahead of you all.    I should like first to speak about the word {conditions} and its true meaning. It is a word which is grossly misapplied in all forms of psychic work. It is given as a reason for this or that failure   for a success  for any peculiarity in result, and it is looked upon as necessary in any apartment in which a meeting is to be held. Rightly and wrongly   usually wrongly. The main factor or essential in obtaining good results lies in the condition of the sitter s mind more than in the room he is in.    The mental attitude and the {physical} state of the sitter is of very much more importance than of the presence of draped windows, thick carpets, exotic perfumes, etc., etc. It is the method of mental approach which matters chiefly. That is a feature often overlooked by even first grade sensitives . . . Certain {extras} if rightly used and properly directed round the apartment, such as a cheerful face, pleasant flowers, laughter and brightness, these are all quite useful assets, but they are not the essentials.    Some people always try to reduce to ridicule communication with the next world, one of the greatest of God s blessings to mankind, and complain of what they consider to be the senseless conditions ruling at a seance. Many of these conditions, as I have said, are meaningless and sometimes a hindrance, but at the same time others are necessary according to the kind of communication sought after.    To make my point, I must recall to you how conditions govern everything, and so much does everything depend upon given suitable conditions that people do not even notice that this is so. The simplest and perhaps the most useful example of this is in making a pot of tea. You must have the tea in a certain condition, you must have the water in a certain condition   if you do not, you get poor results.    {Your flowers}   you have your seeds in a certain condition of dryness and you put them to earth when the climate is in a certain condition, according to time of year, and, once planted, you tend your plants, flowers, trees, everything according to the conditions they {demand.}    We demand conditions. Why should you think that this great scientific work can be governed, mastered by inexperienced hands at any take it or leave it moment?  You cannot reasonably expect it, and if you do, you won t get it!  Conditions govern earth and all forms of life on it, from an earlier state than that when consciousness begins   but I tell you many of the conditions demanded by intelligent workers in this subject are futile and   worse   harmful.    You cannot achieve success in anything, or along any line, by directing your force in opposition to your intelligence. A vast number do, in this subject, and {that} is why there is so much failure. You may as well try to take a photograph without putting any film into the camera, and, because you get no result, say the whole thing is impossible and fraudulent. You must have conditions in order to secure success in any and everything. It is due to lack of these necessary conditions that we fail sometimes to influence a person to do or not to do a certain act.    A father, in spirit life, may be fully conscious of is son contemplating a certain deed, say, suicide or murder, or anything of that kind. Such knowledge will cause great sorrow to the father, and he will work his utmost to influence the son, to direct his thoughts, and destroy the idea of whatever is contemplated; but at such time the son is in an abnormal state of excitement, which nearly always prevents our influence from getting to him and working upon him. It is not at all a state of happiness, for the father, because he is fully aware of his sons acts, and he is powerless to prevent him.    In action we are free. Absolutely free. We have graduated in the Blue School. We are free to go amongst the other spheres. The hands where many or several   or none   of our own people are. We can go to them, and we can take help from those more developed, and give help to those less fortunate. Help by advice, help by demonstration, and help by association. We are still living on the Blue Island; not yet do we pass to the next sphere for domicile.    As we are able to travel among these other lands, so we are able to be in constant touch with earth.  Thoughts of us sent out by people on earth reach us, and we sense from whom they come, and can follow up the person, if so desired. We would not get every thought from anyone who happened to see our names and make a casual remark, but from anyone with whom we were intimate whilst on earth a thought of us will come straight, as along a telephone wire from one house to another, and if we wish we can come.    In this way we are able to help people left behind.  We can follow their actions and their minds, and influence them one way or the other, according to our idea of what is for their good; but we cannot do impossible things even for those dearest to us.    Whilst on earth one can give advice, but one cannot force it into practice   so here we can influence but not create. Having attained this state there is no parting, there is no sting to death, we can be with our own beyond us, with us, below us, and with those still on earth. Separation and partings are not known except by the law of attraction and affection.    We leave people behind on the earth who dutifully mourn for us, who are genuinely upset at {their} loss; but after a while   short or long   their remembrance of us grows thin. They cease to think of us, to recall us, and to remember our companionship. They are the only partings. In some cases even those people come back to our lives when they themselves come to this land. Gradually, as they throw off the influences which dimmed their remembrance of us, they find the foundation of the old affection. Sometimes it is untouched; sometimes spoilt; but these are the only partings.    A spirit who comes here, and is anxious to get in touch with earth ties, may be made more unhappy by being with the earth people, for if they do not understand that he is still alive, they are all sadness, and they think of him as dead   as something finished.    Although the spirit will go to them a great deal at first, the earth people will not know he is there, and seeing them but being unable to make his presence know causes him much disappointment and sorrow, and they are ignorant of his presence and think only of him as dead, he will finally stay away altogether, content to wait until they  join him.    This accounts for many people who are not apparently making any attempt to communicate, and for earth people to say that this cannot be true because their dearest so and so never made any sign to them.    When you are over in this life you will not be continually associated with people who are not of interest to you. On earth you eliminate, as far as practicable, the people who tire and try you   but here that can be done effectively because those feelings and instincts are entirely mutual. The governing force is love. Affections bind people together, and if the love between any two, or any group, is a strong and real thing, then those people are in close unison and happiness together. But wherever the love is not on both or all sides, there is automatically a falling away of the affected party.    Nothing uneven or unequal holds. When you come, through death, you are attracted by the ties of love into the set of people who vibrate the same affection, and if you have had an affection for another which is not equally shared although you will at first be together, you will gradually and yet quietly cease to attract each other, and cease to be in each other s company.                 The State Of Freedom CHAPTER X    Everything is ordered. I have touched lightly upon my first arrival and my impression of the new surroundings, and of my first return to earth and the manner of it. Without giving technical and scientific formula at all, I thing I have given you a fair picture and a rough idea of the next step after earth life.  What I have said applies to all the human race. Whites, blacks and yellows   there is no differentiation; one rule holds for all races of mankind.    I shall pass for the present to a further stage.    I may return to say more about the Blue Island, but now I will leave all life there to continue on its way, and will deal with a further point of development   the state of being rid of most earth instincts. Once rid of these we are able to pass with comparative ease, and almost at will, from one sphere to another, and from this or another sphere back to earth; keeping thereby in close association with our own people   or those of them who desire it. We help by influencing them in their daily lives and actions, and we do this {without in any way retarding our own work, development and construction of character.} Character is the main thing to be studied.    Whilst on the Blue Island I studied, as all do, the secrets of self and of life, and I came to realize the vastness of Creation. It is not life on earth and then life on this island only. As progress is made and earth s inclinations and habits are put aside, so other interests take their place, and then comes the desire for true knowledge. As other do and will do, so did I.  I fell into line also, and as I learned so I progressed. Capacity for wisdom grew with the wisdom acquired.    I had learnt of the existence of other lands besides this island, and at one time it seemed as incredible as the possible existence of this land does to many now on earth; but eventually the time came when I was taken to these other spheres. I cannot tell where they are, but it was like traveling amongst the stars. It seems as if we left our world and traveled through space until we reached another star, another land.    There are several of these other lands, and they are inhabited by former earth people who have progressed sufficiently to qualify for entry into this or that land. These other lands are nearly all inhabited by a higher form of life, a happier form and, individually, a more powerful form, but there are one or two other lands of not so high an order, where happiness is less or not at all, according to whether life on earth was a well or lightly ordered thing.    In these lands the people who are there fail and fail again to find the spirit in themselves to desire to rise, to improve an control themselves, although the necessary strength is offered and offered and even thrust at them.    All races have the gift of free will. All are free agents in determining their own destinies. At all times, not only after the body s death. Just as a father and a mother of a family order the day s routine for their children, and allow the children then to amuse themselves in their own way, so the races of mankind are free to develop and model their lives upon their own individual pattern   being given certain rules to conform to.    All life is originally free, but whilst on earth, through poor comprehension and mismanagement, the individual often thinks he is not a free personage with free will   but he is. As the same father and mother will influence and guide their children, the cause being love, so when we are here and find ourselves able, we do our utmost to help and influence those we love who are still on earth. Always it is the driving force of love which causes us to do our work.    We can be in close touch with our people on earth, and by suggestion and by close association we can influence them. Through our influence often much material good will come to them. We spirit people cannot give material riches to {any} on earth, but we can frequently advise as to the best step to take in a business matter which, if taken, will bring in considerable material wealth. Just as we can influence in a spiritual sense, so we can influence in a business way.    We people over here can see both sides of the argument. When a thing is to be decided between two people we can see both points and can therefore see which is right, and if we play straight we throw our influence in with that, whether it is to the benefit of our earth friend, in a material sense, or not. If we do this, and our earth friend loses or suffers from it, we invariably make it up later in a different way.    If we throw our influence against our own conviction, only in order to help our earth friend, {we} pay for it here ourselves, and our earth friend, who thereby gains unjustifiably, pays for it later, either whilst on earth or when in spirit life. He will have to make return sooner or later; there is no escape, it is automatic.    In saying we can and do influence people on earth, I do not propose to go into the precise process of how we work. It is near enough to say that you know how you influence each other on earth; here the result is the same, although the process is quite different   but that is a matter which each one of you will deal with individually later on, when your own change comes, therefore it is not of necessity nor of interest to you to know now.    You have on earth a saying that {coming events cast their shadows before}. This is a truth. They do cast their influences, and sensitive people can always register them and can often make a guess at their origin.  again, words in brackets were italicized                     Premonitions CHAPTER XI    There are many superstitions and many reasons given to explain what is called {premonition}, but in almost every instance it can be traced to telepathy; there are so many forms of mental sympathy.    The chief form of premonition is that concerning the death of another, friend or relation. Now {always} that can be traced to telepathy. You will argue that perhaps the person about to pass on was not anticipating his death. It may have been through a sudden accident, and yet so and so had a certain sign   a premonition   so many days, or such and such a time, beforehand.    To explain: Mr. A has a premonition about the death of Mr. B. It is followed up later by an accident in which Mr. B is killed. The spirit friends who are interested in Mr. B have been in continual attendance upon him, and are watching him in order to be of use whenever possible; but they cannot make him do this or do that with any certainty, they can only influence him one way or another.    Now, all the actions of Mr. B s life are producing certain effects, some of which Mr. B himself is not at once conscious of . . . His spirit friends are, and they can see, a certain distance ahead, what the results of these actions   the general routine of his life   may be. In this way they can see ahead what is going to occur to Mr. B, and although they will do their utmost to guide him they cannot {act} for him. He sets his own destiny in motion and he alone can alter it.    At such a time, the spirit friends, realizing that Mr. B is in physical danger, will do their utmost to divert his actions and movements: sometimes they are successful, but in this particular instance they are not, and Mr. B meets his death. The influences being used by the spirit people have created a disturbance of thought force around him and, although he was not conscious of it himself, his friend Mr. A has registered it upon his mind and it has reproduced itself in sleep, as a dream, or as a vision built up by thought power and materialized through and from the physical strength of Mr. B. Distance between A and B makes no difference.    Premonitions concerning an arrangement made which is afterwards not fulfilled are caused by the influence of spirit friends trying always to guide their charges to the benefit of themselves. In this way you can figure out the cause of all so called premonitions. In every case it is spirit friends trying to communicate with the person chiefly concerned   he often fails to register what {another} will pick up.                       Residence CHAPTER XII    I come now to the last days on the Blue Island and the taking up of our residence on the next and far more permanent world. The Blue Island is a transient life; a land for acclimatizing the newcomer, and as soon as he s fit he passes from it to what I might term the Real World, inasmuch as each one will be much longer on it than any has yet been on earth.    We can at will return to the Blue Island, and many do so frequently, both to meet newly arrived friends and associates, and to help any person or group with whom we are in sympathy. These are only visits, and we do not ever again return there to live.    Travel here is a very different thing to the methods you all know, and we all set out in a large party for the Real World. Not our whole party, as on first arrival; many weren t ready to leave, but with us were many other spirit people besides those with whom we had originally arrived. There was the same sensation of flying, moving rapidly through the air; then we came to our new home.    After the color and generally striking appearance of the {Blue Island}, this new land appeared less attractive at the outset. It was more toneless in color, the people more engrossed in their regular routine. It seemed as if we had returned to earth life again, it was so like. I thing, on arrival here, we must all have been attracted to different parts of this land, for my own seemed strikingly like parts I had known on earth, and there were also buildings I knew.  Other people have told me the same, so I am confident that according to our race and degree of development so we are automatically attracted to different parts of this new world.    It is in this land that I and most of our people are, and certainly all will be, in due course. We continue our studies and our work of developing spiritually, whilst at the same time controlling and dispersing the few still clinging earth habits and thoughts. We are all very much more conscious of each other in this land, and life resumes a much greater similarity to the life we have known on earth.    We have our homes in the same way and our interests in other people, and according to taste so we are habited together in houses or on the open hillside country. Some people live in very elaborate palaces, and it is very curious to note that many of these people are those who have led very rough and hard lives upon earth. Their idea of Heaven is a palace and a life of ease.    After a period of time, during which they must make specified progress in general development, these people are given their palaces in order to allow them full advantage of environment to make forward steps in their evolution. If they don t progress, they lose their palace and must re qualify for it. This applies to everyone; each has to qualify in order to obtain his desired object; and in order to keep it he must continue his progress and his help to others.    When we come to this land, we have ceased to desire food, drink and sleep; we are now pure spirit in the rough state; there is still more refining to be done in the next phase. Here, also there are {Rest Houses  Houses for Music   Houses for Scientific Research}   Houses for all, and every kind of information and knowledge; and the entrance fee to each and all of these is Desire.    We do not lead a life of continual cramming of information   we lead ordinary earth lives, but with a much keener social interest and much more freedom and exchange of thought. There is no distinction of the classes. Our earth life may be forgotten, in so far as our individual task on earth is concerned, when that task was a matter of little or no interest to us.    It is only the spiritual and mental knowledge and development which hinders and advances the individual here; and spirit knowledge is not hindered by whatever one s job on earth may have been. In this respect there is a great and sudden broadening of the point of view of all comers to this land.    It is a land of freedom. A land of happiness and smiles. A land of happiness brought about through the real love of man for man. A land to work for   a land in which your place is made according to the knowledge you have had whilst upon earth and the way you have used that knowledge.    It is impossible to over emphasize the degree of freedom in this new world, or the joy each and all has in it.    In saying that your happiness is gauged by the knowledge acquired on earth and the application of that knowledge, I am saying what is accurate to the smallest detail, but I would like to explain precisely.    On being established here, in the Real World, each one is interviewed by one of the Advanced Spirit Instructors and the whole record of earth is discussed and analyzed. Reason, motive and result. The full and detailed record contains everything, there is nothing overlooked, and this is the time for paying the bill.  Each is interviewed alone, and there is a minute analysis of all events, acts and thoughts. Then there is the making good to be gone through, the sum total to be paid . . . for all our thoughtlessness and our unkind acts and words   all that have had direct results must be paid for.    We have then to spend time in close touch with earth, in order, by influence, to make good for our past misdoings; make good as far as possible. Also we have the knowledge and full sight of the results of these earlier acts, and they do not bring happiness; but after that state is passed and we can bring all these things into proper perspective and form a table of work, which will gradually and continually be working out results and troubles we have caused, then we can each one settle down to live here in freedom.    The form of life differs here enormously according to temperament, personality, and the influence of earth life. People vary in strange contrast to one another.  Many of us carry on with our same work as on earth.  Here we have no need to work in order to obtain daily livelihood, we work here solely for spiritual refinement and progress; at the same time we keep in touch with our earth interests as a form of recreation.    We are not always, without any break, in one house or another studying this, that and the other; we have a certain program to go through but it has many breaks, and in this {off duty} time we come back to our dear people on earth, and either out of interest and love, or from the desire to be useful, we try our utmost to help them in their material and mental difficulties.    We have every form of recreation here, as I have already told you when dealing with the Blue Island. Any habit or hobby formed on earth can be indulged in here, always providing it is progressive.    From this you can understand that life after death is a very normal and natural affair. We have still our affections, and those which last are still strongly binding links. Between families and friends we have the same affections   and yet not the same, because sometimes on earth there are differences which cause a silence between members of a family, and perhaps over here that family will once more be very united   the earth differences being based solely upon material things   once remove the material and physical and underneath the love often remains.    One great change which death brings is a much broader point of view and a much larger mind. A deeper understanding, a keener intuition, clears away immediately many former difficulties and misunderstandings. Once on this Real World, and once past the first initiation and payment of debts, we are free to do as we wish, but we have to progress or we ourselves curtail our liberties.    It is not an enforced progress, we can take our own time about everything, but we must not allow any of earth s instincts to increase in their power over us.  We have to learn the new conditions and live for them entirely.    Once free, we can travel at will over our own world and over yours. So great is our speed and method of travel that we can be in two places almost simultaneously.    Everywhere we go we are conscious of the general love for one another. It is much more evident than on earth, and that great affection is the direct cause of the general brightness and radiance of this world. I do mean that it gives off rays of light, but rather that the general atmosphere is light in quality and very invigorating and strength giving.    Life here is a grander thing   a bolder thing, and a happier thing for all those who have led reasonable lives on earth, but for the unreasonable there are many troubles and difficulties and sorrows to be encountered. There is a great truth in the saying that {as ye sow, so shall ye reap.}                        General Results CHAPTER XIII    I HAVE been away from my earth life now a number of years, and although I have been in constant and unbroken touch with my old conditions and affections, I have never, since leaving the Blue Island, had any desire to return to the earth for habitation.    There have been many occasions when I have very badly wanted a tongue for a few hours. With my extra sight I have known the right treatment when seeing certain situations being mishandled. At such times I have very badly wanted to return to earth for an hour, in order to be the means of bringing about great improvements   beyond these passing desires I have had no wish ever to take up residence on earth; my travels and my works and studies on this side of the grave have been of such vital interest. Since being here I have acquired greater knowledge, and have been able to pass to earth people {some} of that knowledge, at different times.    Ever since my leaving the world, your world, I have been keenly interested in its development, and very live to all its internal and external difficulties.  Patriotism still holds with me, as with most of us, and will continue to hold so long as I have personal ties upon earth. When there are no longer any of these personal ties remaining my interests will gradually and naturally turn more exclusively to {this} side among my own people, and my place will be filled by another   and so the race goes on   always moving forward, progressing and evolving.    Looking back on it all since I first came to the {Blue Isle} I have great satisfaction in seeing the advance I have made. Coming here was quite a shock to me. I had no idea that my death was so near when that particular year began, and I certainly had no desire that it should be soon. I had an overwhelming number of important things on my hands. Some of these have been able to finish since, and I have followed the progress of many others.    Soon after arrival, I had grown acclimatized to the new conditions, the new appearance of everything, the new power of locomotion and communication. We do not talk to each other very much here, we have a more expressive and intimate way than that. Here, thoughts are communicated from one mind to another without the need of vocal expression, although we {can} talk in earth manner at will.    There are, of course, many and vast differences between my world and yours, but I always find one of the most blessed and merciful differences between the two to be the manner in which the mental is unhindered by the physical. You on earth have mental desires and ambitions of various kinds, for money, success in business, pleasure, power, knowledge, etc.; but always these desires are limited, cramped, often made impossible owing to your physical condition   here, when the mental desire is good, the field is unlimited.    Any mental desire for truth, knowledge, be it what it may, can be gratified in a most astonishing manner in {this} world. Be it good or bad, it will bring its results, and if the desire is bad it will grow in power and must be paid for; if good, it will grow in power also, and will bring strength and happiness with it.    I cannot emphasize to you too much that as {you are}, so {you will be.}    You are now, whilst on earth, making your bodies for your next conditions. These are built up by your present lives on the quality of your thoughts. This world, which I have been in a long time now, is the closest thing imaginable to your earth. It is full of mineral, vegetable, animal, and {all} forms of life.  All the animals you have loved on earth and educated to understanding, will be with you here. Those other animals who belong to no one in particular are here too, but they are in their own places.    You will say, {Oh, then it is only a reflection of our word.} It is not that way   the earth is only a reflection of this world. Earth is not the lasting world. It is the training school. You are not only on earth to amass riches and enjoy life, just for what it is; you are there to learn the truth about your own character, and how to control and develop it, to make full use of all earth s beauties and pleasures, but you must be master, and not allow them to master you.    As I have said, looking back on my life here, I am satisfied with what has been done both in the personal and individual way {and} the bigger way. We spirit people have made great advances in our communications with earth. We have been greatly and enormously helped by the physical strength of the spirits of all the young men and women who passed over during the recent fighting all over the world; not only English, but all.  They brought with them great physical power and determination, and we have been able, through this power, to break down many of the barriers which keep the two worlds apart.    These truths do not conform with the ideas of many people, but that is no reason for saying they are not true. Truth is sometimes unexpected and none too pleasant, but it is always the most powerful, and {will} make itself known   no matter whether it brings pleasure or pain.    Go, each one of you, in reality or imagination, to the edge of a high cliff overlooking the sea. Let it be a bright, starry, frosty night, and go alone. Stand there and meditate. Look down upon the lights of any harbored, anchored boats, and think; then look up to the stars. You know where you are, and you are fully conscious of the flickering and movement of the lights on the boats.    You can see them. You are only a little way off . . . and perhaps you could make them hear if you called, but it would be easier to wait till the darkness breaks when they can see you without any effort on your part.  That is how we spirit people are; conscious of those left behind, some willing to wait, others fighting and struggling to make themselves heard. It is only a little way from earth, and between this, our spirit state and the Great Universe, there is as much distance as between you on the cliff and the farthest star.    {We are only a little way on our journey   nothing yet forgotten. Love still remaining.}                   The Great Ultimate CHAPTER XIV    MY LIFE here has been a very normal, healthy and interesting affair, just as my life on earth was. I have been invested with no powers generally attributed to spirits and fairies, I am still just an ordinary man with an ordinary plain, blunt outlook on life; the change has in no way altered me. The only change there is in me is my greater ability to move speedily and to act quickly. I am rejuvenated, and this is a condition which becomes more marked as time goes on.    Many people who give thought to these subjects no matter what their particular point of view may be, ask the question, {To where is it all leading? What is to be our ultimate state?} This is a question of extreme difficulty to deal with on account of the limitations of the mind; both yours and ours.    I have explained to you that, as you are, so you will be when you come here. When here you will qualify for a further state, which will be your lot in due time, and there you will be exactly as you have made yourself by your life {here}. Better or worse, happier or more unhappy. From that you will go to a further state, another sphere if you like, and there again you will have made your own conditions.    In this further state you will be more self contained; a word I use to express a state of being less dependent upon other people and things for development and progress. In this sphere you will again come in contact with your {whole record}.    A record in full, of all former states: and from this sphere, if your record has qualified to the point of allowing it, you will be given the choice of returning to earth again. Reincarnating. If your record does not qualify for choice in this matter, you will be {directed} either to return or to continue according to what the Teachers   the Purified   consider will afford you most opportunity for re creating yourself and cleansing yourself in the necessary way.    It is from this sphere that spirits return to earth, but by the time the most progressed spirit has reached this state he has forgotten in detail his association with earth. I cannot give the shortest period of time which would be necessary to reach this sphere, but the sojourn in the Real World after the Blue Island is a much longer period than that of mortal life; and in each sphere as progress is made the sojourn is {longer}.    The spirits who have reached this {Return or Stay Sphere,} and are purified and qualified in themselves, those who stand the tests and pass out as Grade I, pass to another and altogether different and lighter land   and each becomes impersonal. Impersonal in the sense that they are no longer {Jack Brown} or {Madge Black;} they are now pure spirit people, and their former love, which had been a personal and individual thing, is no longer for one but equally for all. All are alike to all. The purest tissue of God s love binds one and all.    I have given a brief outline, sufficient for you to form your own ideas, your own mental pictures of Creation and its process. There would be no point in my going further into details, because if I were to give the facts you could not understand the conditions ruling in those advanced states.    I am not able fully to understand them myself, for, as I have said, I am only a little way on my journey, but just far enough to grasp the intense beauty of life, and in life.    As one standing on a higher point than yourselves, and able to see a little more than you see, I can best explain to you that in these further states you receive not merely fifty, or sixty, or even a hundred per cent out of your lives in happiness and joy but you receive comparatively six hundred per cent. This is simply a graphic way of indicating the degree of happiness that obtains here.    Were I able to describe all the processes of our evolution many would say, {Oh, but I don t want that}! But when progress has been made and intelligence brightened and Reality seen as Reality, not as Imagination, they will want it. If I said to an old man in an invalid chair that he could have a motor bicycle, he d say he preferred his invalid chair, but if he were to be a young, robust boy of nineteen again, which do you suppose he d choose? This is the underlying principle.    Do you think that this scheme of the World is hateful and unkind and full of continual partings from all other spirits who are dear to each individually. l have said that there are {no} partings. It is always possible and customary for spirits to keep in close touch with each other on this side. When the highest states of the impersonal are reached there are no partings from dear ones; only a wider opening of that same door of love   a higher, purer love, a Golden or God love   to admit not one or two or twenty but to embrace all.                Christ and Spiritualism CHAPTER XV    UNFORTUNATELY the word {Spiritualism} has been associated with so many misconceptions that it affords scope for misinterpretation, and for this reason thousands of people misunderstand the word and suppose that it deals only with forms of fortune telling and chicanery of all kinds, and must necessarily be wrong and dangerous   therefore the work of anti Christ.    For this reason it is a barred subject. Not only do these people know nothing about it, but they are so horrified at the travesty they themselves have created that they would refuse to hear, see, or read a word upon the subject.    To all people who have knowledge of Spiritualism, this attitude is tiresome an regrettable; nevertheless it exists today, and in great force.    In my concluding chapter I want to say a few simple words on this point.    Spiritualism is not the work of anti Christ. All the teachings of Christ are to be found in the teachings of Spiritualism. Christ taught love amongst mankind, generous thought and generous help for one another. {Love thy neighbor as thyself,} and so on. Spiritualism teaches these same doctrines. Christ was imbued with the Divine Spirit, and He laid down laws upon which His disciples were to model their lives and their work, and in those laws you will find the laws which govern Spiritualism.    Because one of the disciples was a dishonest, weak man, and because some of the workers since then, workers in the churches of various and many creeds have been, and are to this day, weak and sinful in their lives, you do not, any of you, think for one moment that the whole is bad and evil.    You realize that the teachings of Christ were of the highest. Always He spoke of Love as the binding link and the force of all good. I want you to understand, perhaps for the first time, that Spiritualism is based upon the same foundations. All its rules are rules given by Christ Himself.    All the creeds existing upon earth are based upon these same rules. They vary in minor points considerably. What one will allow, another will condemn, and it is for the individual to decide which particular one of all is most fitting to himself. By his choice he will show his ability to grasp the meaning of God s laws, and according to his development so will he select.    The teachings of all alike are limited but some go farther, see farther, and understand more. Just as all roads may converge to a given point, so many creeds follow in the main the teachings of Christ. Some by narrow little roads and byways, some by wide roads, and some by main highways. {Spiritualism is God s Main Highway.}                        THE END                     Those of us viewing the Iran Contragate hearings,          then being broadcast live on TV, had our curiousity peaked          when one committee member began inquiring about an article          alleging secret White House plans to suspend the          Constitution.                    We were even more puzzled when committee chair          Daniel Inouye interrupted him demanding all discussion on          that question take place in closed session, out of public          hearing.                    Not content to wonder, I researched the original          article, transcribed it, and now present it to you for your          urgent consideration.  You have a right to read this.  In          fact, you d better know about it because it s about secret          White House plans to remove your rights by SUSPENDING OUR          UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.

Investigators believe that the advisers           activities extended well beyond the secret arms sales to          Iran and aid to the contras now under investigation.                    Lt. Col. Oliver North, for example, helped draw up          a controversial plan to suspend the Constitution in the          event of a national crisis, such as nuclear war, violent and          widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S.          military invasion abroad.                    When the attorney general at the time, William          French Smith, learned of the proposal, he protested in          writing to North s boss, then national security adviser          Robert McFarlane.                    The advisers conducted their activities through          secret contacts throughout the government with persons who          acted at their direction but did not officially report to          them.                    The activities of those contacts were coordinated          by the National Security Council, the officials and          investigators said.                    There appears to have been no formal directive for          the advisers  activities, which knowledgeable sources          described as a parallel government.                    In a secret assessment of the activities, the lead          counsel for the Senate Iran contra committee called it a           secret government within a government.                     The arrangement permitted Reagan administration          officials to claim that they were not involved in          controversial or illegal activities, the officials said.                     It was the ultimate plausible deniability,  said          a well briefed official who has served the Reagan          administration since      and who often collaborated on          covert assistance to the Nicaraguan contras.                    The roles of top level officials and of Reagan          himself are still not clear.  But that is expected to be a          primary topic when North appears before the Iran contra          committees beginning Tuesday.  Special prosecutor Lawrence          Walsh also is believed to be trying to prove in his          investigation of the Iran contra affair that government          officials engaged in a criminal conspiracy.                  ADVISERS FORMED SHADOW GOVERNMENT, PROBERS SAY                    Much of the time, Cabinet secretaries and their          aides were unaware of the advisers  activities.  When they          periodically detected operations, they complained or tried          to derail them, interviews show.                    But no one ever questioned the activities in a          broad way, possibly out of a belief that the advisers were          operating with presidential          sanction, officials said.                    Reagan did know of or approve at least some of the          actions of the secret group, according to previous accounts          by aides, friends and high ranking foreign officials.                    One such case is the      visit to Libya by          William Wilson, then U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and a          close Reagan friend, to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar          Gadhafi, officials said last week.  Secretary of State          George Shultz rebuked Wilson, but the officials said Reagan          knew of the trip in advance.                    The heart of the secret structure from      to               was North s office in the Old Executive Office Building          adjacent to the White House, investigators believe.                    North s influence within the secret structure was          so great, the sources said, that he was able to have the          orbits of sophisticated surveillance satellites altered to          follow Soviet ships around the world, call for the launching          of high flying spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and          Nicaragua and become involved in sensitive domestic          activities.                                 Many initiatives                    Others in the structure included some of Reagan s          closest friends and advisers, including former national          security adviser William Clark, the late CIA Director          William Casey and Attorney General Edwin Meese, officials          and investigators said.                    Congressional investigators said the Iran deal was          just one of the group s initiatives.  They say exposure of          the unusual arrangement may be the legacy of their inquiry.                     After we establish that a policy decision was          made at the highest levels to transfer responsibility for          contra support to the NSC..., we favor examining how that          decision was implemented,  wrote Arthur Liman, chief counsel          of the Senate committee, in a secret memorandum to panel          leaders Sens. Daniel Inouye, D Hawaii, and Warren Rudman, R           N.H., before hearings began May  .                     This is the part of the story that reveals the          whole secret government within a government, operated from          the  Executive Office Building  by a Lt. Col., with its own          army, air force, diplomatic agents, intelligence operatives          and appropriations capacity,  Limon wrote in the memo, parts          of which were shared with The Herald.                    A spokesman for Liman declined comment but did not          dispute the memo s existence.                    A White House official rejected the notion that          any of Reagan s advisers were operating secretly.                     The president has constantly expressed his          foreign policy positions to the public and has consulted          with the Congress,  the official said.                                  Began in                         Congressional investigators and current and former          officials interviewed    members of the CIA, State          Department and Pentagon    said they still do not have a          full record of the impact of the the advisers  activities.                    But based on investigations and personal          experience, they believe the secret governing arrangement          traces its roots to the last weeks of Reagan s               campaign.                    Officials say the genesis may have been an October               decision by Casey, Reagan s campaign manager and a          former officer in the World War II precursor of the CIA, to          create an October Surprise Group to monitor Jimmy Carter s          feverish negotiations with Iran for the release of             American hostages.                    The group, led by campaign foreign policy adviser          Richard Allen, was founded out of concern Carter might pull          off an  October surprise  such as a last minute deal for the          release of the hostages before the Nov.   election.  One of          the group s first acts was a meeting with a man claiming to          represent Iran who offered to release the hostages to          Reagan.                    Allen    Reagan s first national security adviser             and another campaign aide, Laurence Silberman, told The          Herald in April of the meeting.  they said McFarlane, then a          Senate Armed Services Committee aide, arranged and attended          it.  McFarlane later became Reagan s national security          adviser and played a key role in the Iran contra affair.          Allen and Silberman said they rejected the offer to release          the hostages to Reagan.                               Briefing book theft                    Congressional aides now link another well known          campaign incident    the theft of confidential briefing          materials from Carter s campaign before the Oct.   ,     ,          Carter Reagan debate    to the same group of advisers.                    They believe that Casey obtained the briefing          materials and passed them to James Baker, another top          Reagan  campaign aide, who was White House chief of staff in          Reagan s first term.                    Once Reagan was sworn in, the group moved quickly          to set itself up, officials said.  Within months, the          advisers were clashing with officials in the traditional          agencies.                    Six weeks after Reagan was sworn in, apparently          over State Department objections, then CIA director Casey          submitted a proposal to Reagan calling for covert support of          anti Sandinista groups that had fled Nicaragua after the               revolution.                           THE IRAN CONTRA CONNECTION:              NORTH HAD BIG ROLE IN INNER CIRCLE, INVESTIGATORS SAY                     It is still unclear whether Casey cleared the plan          with Reagan.  But In November      the CIA secretly flew an          Argentine military leader, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, to          Washington to devise a secret agreement under which          Argentine military officers trained Nicaraguan rebels,          according to an administration official familiar with the          agreement.                    About the same time, North completed his transfer          to the NSC from the Marine Corps.  Those who worked with          North in      remember his first assignments as routine,          although not unimportant.                    North, they recalled, was briefly assigned to          carry the  football,  the briefcase containing the secret          contingency plans for fighting a nuclear war, which is taken          everywhere the president goes.  North later widened his          assignment to cover national crisis contingency planning.          In that capacity he became involved with the controversial          national crisis plan drafted by the Federal Emergency          Management Agency.                               NATIONAL CRISIS PLAN                    From      to     , North assisted FEMA, the U.S.          government s chief national crisis management unit, in          revising contingency plans for dealing with nuclear war,          insurrection or massive military mobilization.                    North s involvement with FEMA set off the first          major clash between the official government and the advisers          and led to the formal letter of protest in      from then           Attorney General Smith.                    Smith was in Europe last week and could not be          reached for comment.                    But a government official familiar with North s          collaboration with FEMA said then Director Louis O.          Guiffrida, a close friend of Meese s, mentioned North in          meetings during that time as FEMA s NSC contact.                    Guiffrida could not be reached for comment, but          FEMA spokesman Bill McAda confirmed the relationship.                     Officials of FEMA met with Col. North during               to     ,  McAda said.   These meetings were appropriate to          Col. North s duties with the National Security Council and          FEMA s responsibilities in certain areas of national          security.                     FEMA s clash with Smith occurred over a secret          contingency plan that called for suspension of the          Constitution, turning control of the United States over to          FEMA, appointment of military commanders to run state and          local governments and declaration of martial law during a          national crisis.                    The plan did not define national crisis, but it          was understood to be nuclear war, violent and widespread          internal dissent or national opposition against a military          invasion abroad.                                PLAN WAS PROTESTED                    The official said the contingency plan was written          as part of an executive order or legislative package that          Reagan would sign and hold within the NSC until a severe          crisis arose.                    The martial law portions of the plan were outlined          in a June   ,     , memo by Guiffrida s deputy for national          preparedness programs, John Brinkerhoff.  A copy of the memo          was obtained by The Herald.                    The scenario outlined in the Brinkerhoff memo          resembled somewhat a paper Guiffrida had written in      at          the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., in which he advocated          martial law in case of a national uprising by black          militants.  The paper also advocated the roundup and          transfer to  assembly centers or relocation camps  of at          least    million  American Negroes.                     When he saw the FEMA plans, Attorney General Smith          became alarmed.  He dispatched a letter to McFarlane Aug.  ,               lodging his objections and urging a delay in signing          the directive.                     I believe that the role assigned to the Federal          Emergency Management Agency in the revised Executive Order          exceeds its proper function as a coordinating agency for          emergency preparedness,  Smith said in the letter to          McFarlane, which The Herald obtained.   This department and          others have repeatedly raised serious policy and legal          objections to the creation of an  emergency czar  role for          FEMA.                     It is unclear whether the executive order was          signed or whether it contained the martial law plans.          Congressional sources familiar with national disaster          procedures said they believe Reagan did sign an executive          order in      that revised national military mobilization          measures to deal with civilians in case of nuclear war or          other crisis.                             ORCHESTRATED NEWS LEAKS                    Around the time that issue was producing fireworks          with the administration, McFarlane and Casey reassigned          North from national crisis planning to international covert          management of the contras.  The transfer came after North          took a personal interest, realizing that neither the State          Department nor any other government agency wanted to handle          the issue after it became clear early in      that Congress          was moving to bar official aid to the rebels.                    The new assignment, plus North s natural          organizational ability, creativity and the sheer energy he          dedicated to the issue, gradually led to an expansion of his          power and stature within the covert structure, officials and          investigators believe.                    Meese also was said to have played a role in the          secret government, investigators now believe, but his role          is less clear.                    Meese sometimes referred private American citizens          to the NSC so they could be screened and contacted for          soliciting support for the Nicaraguan contras.                    One of those supporters, Philip Mabry of Fort          Worth, told The Herald earlier this year that in      he was          told by fellow conservatives in Texas to contact Meese, then          White House counselor, if he wanted to help the contras.          After he contacted Meese s office, Mabry received a letter          from Meese obtained by The Herald advising him that his name          had been given to the  appropriate people.                     Shortly thereafter, Mabry said, a woman who          identified herself as Meese s secretary gave him the name          and phone number of another NSC secretary who, in turn, gave          him North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, as contacts.                    Meese s Justice Department spokesman, Patrick          Korten, denies that Meese was part of North s secret contra          supply network and notes that Meese does not recall having          referred anyone to North on contra related matters.                    In addition to North s role as contra commander          and fund raiser, North became secret overseer of the State          Department s Office of Public Diplomacy, through which the          Reagan administration disseminated information that cast          Nicaragua as a threat to its neighbors and the United          States.                    An intelligence source familiar with North s          relationship with that office said North was directly          involved in many of the best publicized news leaks,          including the Nov.  ,     , Election Day announcement that          Soviet made MiG jet fighters were on their way to Nicaragua.                    McFarlane is now believed to have been the senior          administration official who told reporters that the Soviet          cargo ship Bakuriani, en route to Nicaragua from a Soviet          Black Sea port, was probably carrying MiGs.                    The intelligence official said North apparently          recommended that the information be leaked to the press on          Election Day so it would reach millions of people watching          election results.  CBS and NBC broadcast the report that          night.                                CLARK HAD KEY ROLE                    The leak led to a new clash between the regular          bureaucracy and the president s advisers.  The official          State Department spokesman, John Hughes, tried hard to play          down the report, pointing out that it was unproven that the          Bakuriani was carrying MiGs.  At the same time, employees of          the Office of Public Diplomacy, acting under North s          direction, insisted that the crates were inside the ship and          that MiGs were still a possibility.                    To take a closer look, the source said, North          requested a high flying SR    Blackbird spy aircraft be sent          from Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., to fly          over the Nicaraguan port of Corinto while the Bakuriani          unloaded its cargo.  The pictures showed that the Bakuriani          unloaded helicopters, not MiGs.                    North was not the only adviser who operated          outside traditional government channels, investigators have          concluded.                    Others were known as the RIGLET, a semi official          unit made up of North;  Alan Fiers, a CIA Central American          affairs officer;  and Elliott Abrams, the current assistant          secretary of state for inter American affairs, according to          Abrams  subordinate Richard Melton.  Melton revealed the          existence of the RIGLET in a deposition given to the Iran           contra committees.  The name is a diminutive for RIG, which          stands for Restricted Interagency Group.                    Among the RIGLET s actions was ordering the U.S.          ambassador to Costa Rica, Lewis Tambs, to assist the contras          in setting up a front in southern Nicaragua.  Tambs, who          resigned suddenly last year after his links to North were          revealed, testified about the instructions to Iran contra          investigators.                    But perhaps the key to the parallel government was          the role played by Reagan s second national security          adviser, William Clark.  It was during Clark s tenure that          North began to gain influence in the NSC.                    Clark also recruited several midlevel officers          from the Pentagon and the CIA to work on a special Central          American task force in      to push aid for El Salvador, a          task force member said.                     Judge Clark was the granddaddy of the system,  he          said.   I was working at the Pentagon on another issue when          my boss said that because of special circumstances, I was to          be reassigned to the task force.                     A former administration official familiar with          Clark s activities said Clark also had approved contacts          between Vatican Ambassador Wilson and Libya before Wilson s          November      journey, which came after McFarlane replaced          Clark at the NSC.                    The former official said Wilson also had carried          out secret missions for the Reagan administration in a Latin          American country where Wilson reportedly maintained contacts          with high level officials.  The source asked that the          country not be identified because the system is still in          place and had reduced tensions by circumventing the regular          bureaucracies of both countries.                    Calls to Wilson s and Clark s offices in          California were not returned. 		  The following anonymous press release was passed to us by friends  of ours in Washington who thought we would want to know.  It was  sent to them by a confidential source who supposedly obtained it  from the U.S. office of the Russian news agency TASS.  Presumably,  TASS received it by mail or fax from persons unknown. NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  ***************************************************************** THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF LIBERTY HAVE ACQUIRED A FIVE     MEGATON  NUCLEAR WEAPON FROM SPECIFIED GROUPS WITHIN RUSSIA.  THE NUCLEAR  WEAPON WILL BE DETONATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA IN     .  THE  PURPOSE OF THE DETONATION IS TO COMPEL THE UNITED STATES  GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE ALL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ON THE ALIEN/  EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFTS HOUSED UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE  OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE AT THE GROOM DRY LAKE/PAPOOSE LAKE  FACILITIES, EIGHTY      MILES NORTH NORTHWEST OF LAS VEGAS. ***************************************************************** NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  NEWS RELEASE  ANALYSIS.  You know darn well the place that s going to be  targeted.  Vegas!  Blowing up any other part of Nevada would be  pointless since it s a wasteland anyway.  You can t do much damage  to the Nevada Test Site.  It s already been nuked!  The Sons and  Daughters wouldn t want to blow up Area    either because then  they could be destroying the very evidence they seek.  No, Las  Vegas is the only place worth blowing up, and all we can say is,   Bravo!   We saw the exact same thing at the end of the recent  broadcast of Steven King s  The Stand.   Lucifer and his disciples  got bombed on Fremont Street, taking the rest of the town with  them.  We thought it was the most upbeat part of this end of the  world mini series. We would never condone any such terrorist action.  Still, if it  has to happen, there could be worse places.  The cultural losses  will be nil, and many of those lives so tragically lost are, quite  frankly, the sort of low life Vegas scum this country can do  without.  We ll miss the all you can eat buffets and the four         hour Wal Marts, but, heck, we ll survive.  If it means driving  to Cedar City to shop, we ll make that sacrifice.  They ve got a  Wal Mart there and a couple of big supermarkets, and those good  Mormon people  the original  Downwinders   have plenty of  experience in dealing with fallout.   The loss of Las Vegas could be seen as a tragic but ultimately  beneficial societal cleansing, but we are not sure it will help  much in cracking the UFO mystery.  This event is going to create a  lot of noise, both literally and figuratively.  It could take a  decade to mop up the mess, and in the meantime no one is going to  be thinking much about the alleged alien/extraterrestrial crafts  at Groom/Papoose lakes.  If anything, an event like this would  encourage even closer military control of Southern Nevada.        BUT IS IT TRUE?       On the subject of UFOs at Area   , Psychospy is proud to sit  squarely on the fence.  Whatever the truth may be, we don t yet  find the evidence compelling enough to march on the White House or  blow up a major city in protest.  We ve heard endless stories of  amazing lights in the sky in this area.  Most of these, including  many well publicized reports and the things that we ve seen  ourselves, appear to us to be routine misperceptions of military  flares and aircraft lights.  Newcomers do not appreciate the huge  volume of military traffic here or the difficulties of judging the  motion of a distant light.  Even the few sighting reports that we  can t explain don t seem to lead us anywhere.  So you ve seen a  unworldly light in the sky.  Even if it happened as you say it  did, where does the investigation lead you?  All you can usually  conclude, after recording the sighting, is that the case is     DAH dum    UNEXPLAINED! Forty five years of collecting sighting reports has lead the UFO  movement nowhere.  Idealistic investigators have filled out  thousands of neatly ruled forms recording the size of the object,  its brightness and structure, its movement across the sky, a  description of the occupants if they land and step outside...   Most such reports rely on human perception and memory and thus are  automatically suspect.  The endless stacks of sighting reports,  although periodically regurgitated for books and TV shows, mostly  collect dust in archives and result in no practical human effect.   The skeptics remain skeptical, while the believers can only agree  that  They are here!  and it s time to get mad as hell about it. Get mad at whom?  Why, the government of course.  It s senseless  to get angry at the aliens, because they apparently don t give a  damn what we think and certainly aren t going to sit around to be  harangued.  The government, on the other hand, can t escape the  wrath of its citizens, and it has to respond at least when its  funding is threatened.  The focus of attention by UFO activists is  the U.S. Air Force, on the theory that if anybody knows anything  about ships in the sky, it must be them.  They ve got aircraft on  continuous patrol, spy satellites ringing the globe, advanced  radar blanketing the skies, some totally  boss  radio and video  equipment and satellite dishes that can get ALL the channels. If the UFOs are real, then it is a reasonable assumption that the  Air Force knows more about them than we do and that it is  withholding this information from the public.  That doesn t  necessarily imply that the Air Force has any answers.  Perhaps  they have only attained a more advanced state of befuddlement than  the rest of us and are loathe to admit how confused they are.  On  the other hand, the Air Force could be engaged in extensive  contacts and agreements with the aliens.  The aliens could already  be entrenched here, messing with our society  or at least our  minds  and telling the governments of the world what to do. The only flaw in any government cover up theory is our knowledge  about how the government functions in all its other activities.   The only human bureaucracies we have ever had experience with seem  mildly incompetent and usually leak their secrets like a sieve.   If many workers know about the Air Force s UFO data, it is hard to  imagine them all keeping quiet.  Washington is full of Deep  Throats, frustrated with their employer, who are dying to spill  the beans about whatever scandal they have access to.  That a  government agency is involved in any kind of alien research  program is instantly newsworthy to both skeptics and believers.   In the cutthroat underworld of Washington politics and media, it  is hard to imagine any such program surviving for very long  without its existence being leaked and widely criticized. On the other hand, maybe the story has been leaked all along but  sounds just too wacky for most people to take seriously.  It has  been widely reported that the captive aliens at Area    like  strawberry ice cream.  Even if a report like this is true, it  doesn t go far in endorsing the alien presence in most people s  eyes.  The mainstream media can t do much with a far out story  unless there is some reportable human connection.  That the aliens  eat strawberry ice cream isn t news.  What might make the papers  is the atrocious price the government is paying for that ice cream  and how it has given all the business to Baskin Robbins without  competitive bidding. The only sort of government UFO research program we find credible  would be a relatively small and heavily compartmentalized one  accomplishing what we expect of government bureaucracies  that is,  very little.  There is only one thing that the government does  well, and that is stonewall.  Since arriving in Rachel, we have  upgraded our estimates of the government s ability to withstand a  siege and keep its workers quiet.  Easily   ,    employees have  worked at Groom Lake over the years, but hardly any will speak  about the place publicly.  What most of these people know is  probably mundane, but the fact that the government can keep such  tight control over so many people suggests that the enforcement  mechanism is highly effective.  Most workers turn pale if you ask  them the price of a steak at the commissary; they really clam up  when you ask them anything serious. We have developed a respect for the government s ability to  withhold static knowledge  that is, to stockpile data and not let  anyone else have it.  At the same time, since coming here, we have  significantly downgraded our estimates of what workers can  accomplish in such an oppressive environment.  Security  restrictions eat up resources, cripple scientific communication  and sap all initiative and creativity from the human employees.   Given enough funding for guards, locks and redundant safeguards,  the government might be able keep an exotic body of knowledge  secret for decades, but at the cost of not being able to do  anything with it. If the government is withholding proof of alien life, here s what  to look for:  A vault of poorly processed data, guarded by morons  and managed by bureaucrats who are crippled by their own  regulations.  Nothing is accomplished in this air conditioned  sanctum.  Meetings are held and problems discussed, but real  actions and decisions are always put off for another day.  As long  as the data remains secure and funding to maintain the security  apparatus continues to roll in, there s no pressure to do anything  at all. So what is really out there at Area   , beyond the impressive  security, inside the deep bunkers, behind the big steel doors?   Maybe alien craft, maybe Auroras  or maybe just a bunch of bored  technicians sitting around in white lab coats playing cards.        NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE        THE MEDIA: OUT OF CONTROL?  was the cover story on the June     issue of the NEW YORK TIMES SUNDAY MAGAZINE.  There was also, on  page   , a   page article by Donovan Webster entitled   Area       The cold war still rages in the Nevada desert, site of an air base  so secret it doesn t exist.   A Times reader   allegrezza@tnpubs.enet.dec.com , posted this summary to the Skunk  Works mailing list....     As previously noted, the NY Times Magazine,    June issue,  contained an article on Glenn Campbell and Groom Lake.  The writer  spent a day with Glenn, observing Groom and dodging the security  folks, only to end up being ID ed and released by a local  sheriff s deputy.  There was also more detail than I ve seen  elsewhere about the pending lawsuit against the Government filed  by    former Nellis area workers who claim that they were exposed  to hazardous materials emanating from open burn pits at Groom.     As the article focused on Glenn and the politics surrounding  the base secrecy issue, there was little technical detail on any  of the testing supposedly going on at Groom.  Aurora and the TR  A  were mentioned, but only in passing.     Perhaps the most interesting part of the article, for me, was  the following quote from an Air Force spokesman  no unit or  organization affiliation given :     <quote> Meanwhile, as Campbell continues playing to an ever  increasing audience, his efforts are not lost on the Air Force,  which he s placed on his  Desert Rat  mailing list for free.   We  read his publication,  says Air Force Col. Douglas Kennett,  and  we know what Mr. Campbell s doing near a base that may  or may  not  exist.  While Mr. Campbell says the base is there, and while  the Soviets appear to have photographed a base there, the Air  Force is aware of those times when Mr. Campbell or Russian spy  satellites might be looking us over  and we can adjust our  activities for that.  That is, if any activities are going on at a  base that may  or may not  exist.         NOTABLE QUOTES       LARRY KING COMING From a television column in the WASHINGTON POST, July   :     When we started typing this item we asked ourselves  have we  on a very slow summer day been reduced to this?...     On Oct.   Larry King will do a live, on location special, with  phone calls, of course, from Rachel, Nev.,  in the shadow of the  U.S. government s super secret air base known as Area     on  TNT...     It s called  The UFO Cover Up: Live from Area   .   Area   ,  TNT explains,  also known as Groom Lake, is an enormous military  installation hidden deep in the hostile Nevada Desert  so secret  the Pentagon won t confirm its existence.   Larry s guests will  include Glenn Campbell, who heads Secrecy Oversight Council in  Rachel, and technology expert Mark Farm er   a.k.a. Agent X   who  specializes in spying on secret government aviation projects ...     And when we had finished typing this item we were forced to  ask ourselves  has Larry King been reduced to this?...  DOES AURORA EXIST? From an article in the NEW YORK TIMES, July  , about attempts by  Senator Robert Byrd to force the Air Force to revive the SR     Blackbird   Spy Plane That Came in From Cold Just Will Not Go Away  in the Senate ...     When the Pentagon canceled the Blackbird in     , citing the  huge cost of operating and maintaining the fleet, it assured  Senator Byrd and a handful of his senior colleagues on the Armed  Services and Intelligence Committees that it was working on a very  fast, very expensive, very secret reconnaissance plane to be a  successor to the Blackbird.     But that program collapsed after consuming several hundred  million dollars, according to members of Congress and their aides.   And despite rumors that another successor is in the works, they  said, nothing of the sort is on the horizon at the secret Air  Force base in Nevada where classified prototypes of state of the  art aircraft are flown.  COMMENTS:  You can take this any way you want.  If true and no  Aurora is flying, then protecting it is no longer an issue of  national security  is it?  Shouldn t it be revealed to the  taxpayer exactly how many hundreds of millions of dollars were  spent?   We suspect a very large  several.   NIFTY BOOK.   The following comes from an amusing government sponsored document  entitled,  Meeting the Press:  A Media Survival Guide for the  Defense Manager,  by Judson J. Conner.   Sent to us by  trader@cup.portal.com.   It s a slim book packed with practical  tips for military commanders on  Facing a Swarm of Killer  Reporters,  handling a  Press Ambush  and otherwise managing those  pesky journalists.  We read it in one sitting and eagerly  recommended it to those on both sides of the microphone.   Available for $  per copy from the U.S. Government Printing  Office, Washington DC      .  Visa/MC:             .  Among the  advice...     Common sense and military policy dictate that you should  answer press queries fully and accurately, even when those answers  tend to make you look bad.  But human nature advises otherwise,  and it is often difficult to choke back the impulse to evade the  hard questions.  This impulse can really do you in, for evasions  always come back to haunt, and they are malevolent ghosts.     A  no comment  can be equally damaging.  The reporter will  probably quote you in the story, not only to let the public  and  his editor  know that he offered you a chance to tell your side,  but also to let everyone know you are guilty.  The dictionary  tells us that  no comment  merely means you prefer not to talk  about the subject, but the readers know better.  They know very  well you are pleading the Fifth Amendment to cover up your  incompetence.  NELLIS COMMANDER RESPONDS From an article in the LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL, July  , about the  pending promotion of Nellis Air Force Base commander Maj. Gen.  Thomas R. Griffith   Commander s career soars to new heights :      Griffith  defended the Air Force s recent move to withdraw   ,    acres of public land as a buffer zone around its secret  Groom Lake base in Lincoln County,    miles west of Alamo.      If we have to take security measures to do the things we want  to do, we ll do it.  We just can t have Boy Scouts roaming around  in the area,  he said.     When decisions are made, they re based on the recommendation  of people like me who are in the service of our country,  he said.    At some point people have to have confidence in us and  in  the  process.   CAMMO DUDES RESPOND? The following graffiti was found on a military  Restricted Area   sign in a remote area of public land near Freedom Ridge.  As seen  in the New York Times Magazine, June   , Psychospy had drawn a big   X  across the sign and written  Misplaced Sign  on it because it  was well outside the actual military border.  Additional graffiti  has appeared on the sign within the past week, author unknown:     Glenn Campbell is a stupid faggot and so are his loyal  followers!         CLARIFICATION       Some readers got the impression from DR #   that Psychospy was  ready to throw in the towel on the land grab.  Responding to the  continuing MFF, we said:     We almost wished they would just take the damn land and be  done with it.  We assure both our supporters and the loyal opposition that we  were speaking figuratively and our siege has not ended.  Just  recently, in fact, we installed at our Research Center a big  satellite dish, the ultimate status symbol here in the outback and  a clear message to our enemies  who are everywhere  that we are  here for the long term.  As an added benefit, we now receive the  trash/sleaze/Simpsons/X Files network, east and west feeds, so we  can watch ourselves on  Encounters  twice on the same night. The land grab fight is not over, and regardless of what the  outcome may be, there is still plenty of political mileage on  those      acres.  You never what may turn up there:  maybe the  Nicole Simpson murder weapon!  Whatever cards Fate may deal us, we  assure the public that Psychospy and his faggot minions will  cheerfully take advantage of the hand.  The stated reason for the  withdrawal   To ensure the public safety, blah, blah...   is  plainly insufficient and we believe creates a legal vulnerability.   This, in turn, generates free floating political energy which  might be tapped in elegant ways that may not yet be obvious.    Opportunistic  describes our philosophy. It  has long been believed  that gravity is the fundamental  cause  of  solar radiation.  The  presently  popular  Hydrogen/Fusion  Core  theory  rests  on  the  assumption  that  the  mutual gravitational attraction  of  the  Sun s  individual atoms override all other acting forces, thereby causing the  Suns  mass  to contract. This in turn creates the  internal  pressures  which inaugurate nuclear fusion within the Sun s core. This  scenario appears to be reasonably logical at a glance, but  when  viewed  in  the  sharp light of  observational  evidence,  it  becomes  glaringly  obvious that the reasoning upon which  the  Hydrogen/Fusion  Core theory rests is unsound  and quite erroneous. Despite  the fact that virtually every major solar observation  is  at  odds  with this popular solar model, physicists continue to  subscribe  to it because there does not seem to be a logical alternative.  The wound caused by this dilemma is deep and there for all to see; the  ability  to  control a sustained fusion reaction  continues  to  elude  researchers, chiefly because of the alchemic approach with which  they  attempt to apply their craft.  The reason for this sad state of affairs is simple: Fusion research is  so  costly  that in their eagerness to magnetically  cage  the  fusion  reaction, scientists forgo the necessary research needed to understand  what goes on in the fusion process.  It is not unlike a blind man attempting to restrain a beast he  cannot  see;  the blind man builds traps and cages without  understanding  the  nature of the beast.  Such an attempt must surely end in failure. PLASMA is the name of the beast that we must strive to understand;  it  is  a   super  hot gas of disassociated electrons  and  protons.  When  united  within  a common magnetic field it is  capable  of  performing  incredible configurations.  Its  nature is so different from solid, liquid or gas states, that  it  has been designated a state of matter in its own right: a plasma,  the   fourth state of matter. Faced  with  such an awesome discovery, it would  seem  reasonable  to  assume nothing is as we expected it to be. In the light of this  newly  discovered  state  of matter, we should proceed as if  perceiving  the  universe  for  the first time. NONE of the four known  forces  in  the  universe    the Strong, Weak, Electromagnetic and gravitational,   nor  their interactions with the known states of matter   may be taken  for  granted when we know there is a new player on the field. When  the dynamic state of the plasma was realized,  solar  physicists  seem   to  have  been  reluctant  to  consider  the  Sun   anew;   the  intermittently arriving new knowledge of  plasma states continue to be  ignored  or   hastily incorporated into a solar theory  already  beset  with  unreconcilable  contradictions, resulting in  a  hodge podge  of  discontinuous conjectures.  The  focal  point of this current dilemma lies in the  fact  that  our  science   community   suffers  from  an  unshakable   faith   in   the  inviolableness  of  mass/gravity.  It is taken for  granted  that  the  gravitational  force is dependent on the quantity of  matter  present.  This is an unproven conjecture   an act of faith. Such an attitude has for too many years confined potentially  creative  ideas  within constrictions which in reality do not exist.  I  believe  strongly  that such unbending dogma does not belong in the  quest  for  truth, because it has no relation to the objective universe.   A SOLAR SHELL Our  Sun  is  empty;  its mass is distributed  in  a  shell  about  an   Absolute vacuum.  As  I shall demonstrate, an Absolute vacuum induces gravity; it  is  a  rift  upon  which  mass/energy space  gravitationally  implodes.  This  implosion continuously heats the Sun s plasma which in turn  maintains  the  Sun s Absolute vacuum. I call this the Gravity/Vacuum  Cycle,  or  the GRAVAC Cycle. The electromagnetic potential of a given quantity of mass in a  plasma  state  is   X    to the   th times stronger    than its  gravitational  potential. Because of this, the Sun can radiate by the interlocking of  an   induced  gravitational  force  that  is  brought  about  by   the  electromagnetic force. This  comes about because the Sun s plasma is magnetically  polarized,  repelling  electrons from electrons and protons from protons. By  this  process  the mass of the Sun is magnetically repulsed and flies  apart  creating  an  Absolute Vacuum. In turn, this Absolute  Vacuum  induces  gravity.  The induced gravity restrains the Sun s plasma from  further  outward  expansion,  and  it is the struggle  between  the  inhibiting  induced  gravity and the repulsive magnetic properties of  the  plasma  which cause the solar shell to radiate. PROOF For this solar model to work, it requires that absolutely no mass, nor  radiation  can  travel  through an  Absolute  vacuum.  Therefore,  the  experimental  evidence  of  this solar model rests  on  the  following  proof: *It can be demonstrated that neutrinos cannot pass through the Sun*   Small  subatomic particles called neutrinos emanate from stars.     To  an  observer  on Earth, each star has its  own  neutrino  fingerprint,  which  can  be determined by the angle of neutrino  approach  and  the  different neutrino energy levels that individual stars produce.  Because  neutrinos are so small and have no charge, most are  able  to  pass  through  the  Earth without  hitting  anything.  Astrophysicists  believe  that a flow of neutrinos  would pass through the Sun  without  the majority of the neutrinos being stopped by collisions.     But is this so? Imagine  that you are observing neutrinos emanating from an  energetic  star  which  is  about to be eclipsed by the Sun.  When  the  star  is  eclipsed, present logic would dictate that neutrinos from the eclipsed  star would pass through the Sun.  I propose that they will not.  It is my prediction that the neutrino flow from the star will stop  at  the moment of occultation   when the star passes behind the sun.   The  reason for this is because the Sun s interior is not a ball of mass in  conventional  space, as it is presently believed;    on the  contrary,  it is an Absolute vacuum through which nothing passes. Of course, it is not so easy to look for neutrinos passing through the  Sun.  An  actual  experiment  would be  more  complicated,  but  could  probably be performed along these lines: Due  to the fact that neutrino collisions are scarce, one has to  rely  on  a  record  compiled  through time in  order  to  get  an  accurate  determination. You will need a computer and as extensive a compilation  of recorded data of neutrino collisions as possible. The greater  span  of time the records cover, the more accurate the result. Take  the  orbit of the Sun   as seen from Earth,  and break  it  down  into      windows or  sectors  on the plane of the ecliptic,  one  for  each  day of a year. The Sun will pass through all     sectors in  one  year, spending    hours in each sector. Design  a  program  for  the computer so that it  will  list  all  the  neutrinos with an angle of approach that comes within the band divided  into     sectors.  Eliminate  all  neutrinos  from  your data  that  show  energy  levels  consistent with those of our Sun.  Now compile the sectors that the Sun was in each day. Compare them  to  the     other sectors that the Sun was not in. If  present  theories on stellar physics are correct,  then  neutrinos  from  stellar and galactic sources should flow unimpaired through  the  Sun, and there will be  NO DISCERNIBLE QUANTITATIVE DIFFERENCE between  the Sun sectors and the     other sectors that the Sun was not in.  This will not be so.  I  predict  that  the  data will  exhibit  a  CONSISTENT  DECREASE  of  interstellar and intergalactic neutrinos within the solar sectors.   ELUSIVE NEUTRINOS This  chapter  offers  observational  evidence  which  led  me  to  my          conclusions. Problem: Dr.  Raymond  Davis  of the Brookhaven National  Laboratory  has  been  monitoring  the emanation of neutrons from the Sun since     , and  he  has demonstrated that the flow of these neutrinos amounts to less than   /   of  the amount anticipated by the current  hydrogen  fusion  core  theories.    Why? Solution: The deficiency in the neutrino count may be accounted for as  follows;   neutrinos  originate from, or near, the Sun s surface.  Since  nothing  can  travel  through  the Sun s  Absolute vacuum  interior,  only  the  neutrinos produced on the side of the Sun facing us reach the Earth. Those neutrinos originating from the   opposite side of the Sun cannot  penetrate  the Sun s absolute vacuum interior and so escape the  Earth  based observer.  This  is the cause for the lesser neutrino flow observed to be  coming  from the Sun. Problem: When  sunspots  occur  on the Sun s photosphere,  the  neutrino  count  drops. Neutrinos  have  no charge and so cannot be affected by  the  magnetic  field of sunspots on the Sun s surface. If  neutrinos originate from the Sun s core and travel outwards,  then  sunspots  on  the photospheric surface should have no  effect  on  the  neutrinos.  These  subatomic  particles should pass  to  the  observer  unimpeded,  yet  the  neutrino  count  is  diminished  during  sunspot  activity.    Why? Solution: Neutrinos originate near the Sun s photospheric surface. Within  sunspots  there is decreased temperature  and  luminosity,  so  there  is less likelihood of neutrino production; hence a decrease  of  neutrinos during sunspot activity.  SUNSPOTS Problem: Sunspots are depressions in the Sun s photospheric surface.    If  the  interior  of a sunspot is closer to the Sun s supposed core, why  does  it get cooler and darker and not hotter and brighter in these areas? Solution: The Sun has no core.  A  sunspot  depression  is darker because it is closer  to  the  Sun s  Absolute vacuum interior. THOUGHT MODEL If the Sun s mass is only a thin shell of matter, how does one account  for its powerful gravitational attraction? It is time for a thought model.  Imagine  the  air in front of you. Imagine now that you  can  apply  a  force  to  expel  the air away from a given volume.   First,  you  may  notice that the most efficient shape to maintain a vacuum is a sphere. Next,  you  might observe that the exterior air is  attracted  to  the  vacuum      an  attraction which falls away with  the  square  of  the  distance from the source. This attraction is a feature which  exhibits  the same characteristics as the force of gravity. To illustrate this concept, stir a cup of tea or coffee and  carefully  pour in some milk. Notice how the interior of the vortex moves  faster  than the area further out from the vortex. A  vortex has a low pressure interior and high pressure  exterior.  It  behaves in a manner identical to that of the planets orbiting the Sun,  in that both phenomena obey Kepler s Second Law of Planetary Motion       which is a notable characteristic of gravity. Another  way  you  can observe this attraction at work is  to  hold  a  vacuum cleaner nozzle up to a source of smoke. The attraction of smoke  to  the  vacuum nozzle will fall off with the square of  the  distance  from the nozzle, just like gravity. Let us take our thought model into the real universe. Space    any space   anywhere, contains a measure of mass/energy.  The  proof of this is the Background Radiation which pervades our universe.  Even  the  thinnest  space is a veritable soup of  radiation,  virtual  particles  and  even whole atoms passing through any given  volume  at  phenomenal speeds.     It  follows that the laws of pressure that we applied to  our  thought  model  should  hold true anywhere in the universe; wherever  there  is  pressure, a vacuum will attract.  If an Absolute vacuum were possible, what behavior would we expect  of  its nature? How would the universe respond to such a phenomenon? Dictionaries  describe a vacuum as:  A space devoid of  matter.   This  definition is no longer a sufficient description of a vacuum, since it  appears  that  all  space in the Universe  contains  some  measure  of  mass/energy.  Perhaps  a better description would be:  A Vacuum  is  a  volume devoid of space.  Such a volume might be quite different from conventional space.  Since  temperature  is  a result of mass/energy space, it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the temperature of an Absolute Vacuum must  be  absolute  zero. If time is a consequence of mass/energy space, then an Absolute Vacuum  must  be  without time. An observer within such a field would  not  be  affected  by the time frame of exterior space; time would stand  still  for that observer while the exterior universe raced on. A  magnetic  field  is a manifestation of mass/energy but  it  is  NOT  mass/energy  in itself. Because of this it seems reasonable to  assume  that a magnetic field may exist within an absolute vacuum.  In  our  thought  model  we used an  imaginary  force  to  maintain  a  continuous vacuum. Is there any way of demonstrating the existence  of  this force? PLASMA: THE SUPER HOT GAS As I mentioned in the introduction, it was not long ago, that  physics  classified matter into only three states: Solid, liquid, and gas.  It  was not realized until recently that a gas heated to a  very  high  temperature  does not obey the law of gasses; it displays  a  behavior  unique  to its own nature and scientists have only recently  begun  to  probe its secrets.     So different is this state from a regular  gas,  that it has been classified as a fourth state of matter: a plasma.     Because all stars consist of this super hot gas, it is estimated  that  over  ninety  percent  of  the  known  universe  exists  in  a  plasma  state.      Put  simply,   plasma  is  a super hot gas  in  which   electrons  are  stripped away from protons, placing particles of like polarity in  the  same camp. Plasmas  which are shot through a plasma gun   a magnetic field,   and  into  a  vacuum tube display well  defined  structure.  Unfortunately,  because  of  the speed      miles per second,  with which  the  plasma  makes its way down the vacuum tube, photos reveal only a glimmering of  the  complexity that can be contributed to plasma structure.  However,  it  is known that the plasma structure can evolve  into  a  helix like  flow composed of two separate streams, one consisting of electrons and  the  other  of  protons. Furthermore, it has been  observed  that  the  structure  as  a  whole  maintains a stable shape  that  can  best  be  described as a cross between a doughnut and a  Slinky     a toy spring  that can  walk  down a staircase,    turned in on itself.      It  is  significant  that  electrons and  protons  can  organize  into  separate  camps, because like particles of the same charge  repel  one  another. If  it is possible to produce a plasma configuration where the  mutual  repulsion  of particles occur, then it is likely that the volume  left  in their wake is an Absolute Vacuum. It  strikes me that it would be a fruitful enterprise to monitor  some  future plasma experiments with a sensitive gravimeter to see if  known  plasma configurations exhibit inducing gravity characteristics.  RUDIMENTS OF THE DYNAMIC GRAVAC CYCLE Although it is highly possible that the following scenario is a  gross  oversimplification, I believe it to be an accurate thumbnail rendition  of  the Sun s mode of propagation. I call it the Solar  Gravity/Vacuum  Cycle, or the Solar GRAVAC cycle: Imagine  a  gaseous giant, perhaps a little bigger than  Jupiter.  The  gravitational sum of its mass causes intense pressure and so generates  atomic fusion at its center.  The  fusion reaction splits up protons and electrons which are  forced  into like camps, where they repel one another. However,  the  plasma  can only travel  outwards  a  finite  distance,  because it has left an Absolute Vacuum in its wake. The attraction of mass/energy space towards the Absolute Vacuum causes  a gravitational implosion. The plasma has nowhere to go. It cannot go further inwards, because of  the  repulsive magnetic field; nor can it expand outwards, due to  the  gravity holding it back   what s a plasma to do? To  answer this question, try the following:  Rub your hands  together  fast and furious. See how they get hot? The  solar  hydrogen  shell is under intense pressure  at  the  vacuum  boundary  and  this causes the Sun s radiation.  The  released  energy  maintains  the plasma because electrons are stripped from protons  and  so  the cycle repeats, thereby maintaining the radiation of  the  Sun.  The  energy  needed to maintain a total vacuum of a  given  volume  is  equal  to the energy radiating from its boundary. In the case  of  our  sun, that is  .   X    to the    ergs/sec.      Let us now review the cycle: A primordial giant planet   larger than Jupiter   inaugurates standard  gravitational  compression in core  of  proto sun...Pressure...Nuclear  Fusion.....Plasma.....Electrons     form    Camp/     Protons     form  Camp....Magnetic repulsion....Induced Gravitational Attraction... And then back to   Pressure. .... This concept is in harmony with the conservation of angular  momentum,  in that it accounts for the relatively slow rotation of our Sun.  Jupiter,  the  fifth  planet from the Sun, has  by  far  the  greatest  portion of angular momentum of the Solar System. If the Sun contracted  from  a cloud of hydrogen, one would expect the center to  rotate  the  fastest,  like a spinning ice skater will rotate faster if  she  draws  her  arms into her side. The GRAVAC scenario suggests that  the  early  proto Sun s  spin was considerable while it was a dense ball of  mass,  but as it inaugurated nuclear fusion and expanded into a thin shell of  plasma, it lost its angular momentum   like the ice skater letting her  arms out and slowing down.       HELIOSEISMOLOGY   THE RING OF TRUTH A whole new science has recently sprung up called Helioseismology.  It  has  been  observed that the Sun vibrates, rather like a bell.  It  is  presently  believed that solar resonances are propagated  acoustically  from the Sun s core.     But is this so? Solar  oscillations  came as a complete surprise  to  solar  theorists  because  one  does not usually associate structures  that  get  denser  towards  their  center as good candidates for  effective  oscillators.  Hollow  structures,  such as bells are good oscillators; so too  is  a  GRAVAC Sun. We  know  from studying the powerful magnetic fields that  erupt  from  sunspot  depressions that the Sun is capable of  propagating  interior  magnetic fields reaching thousands of gauss.     It  is  this  interior  field  which  causes  the  Sun s  magnetically  sensitive outer shell to dance upon the interior magnetic field,  like  the oscillations produced by an acoustic speaker.  A  blind folded  person would be hard pressed to tell  whether  he  is  being addressed directly or via a speaker. The  same  is true for Helioseismology; the observer is blind  to  the  interior and so the information is interpreted in the light of present  concepts of solar theory. Helioseismologists have discovered a condition in the Sun s  shallower  layers  which  is at variance with conventional core  models:  Through  frequency splittings resulting from the Sun s rotation, it is observed  that  the rotation actually decreases with depth. It is hard  for  any  core  theory to come to terms with this lack of angular  momentum.      This  observation  of  the Sun suggests an inversion    a  sun  turned  inside out. RELATED NATURAL PHENOMENA Vocal  cords  produce compressional waves   high and low  pressures     that  travel  through the air. These waves are received  by  the  ear,  which   converts   them  into  electro chemical  impulses   that   are  distributed to the relevant centers of the brain.     The  ear also acts as a mechanism of body balance;  the  semi circular  canals  allow  the  brain to determine the position  of  the  head  in  relation to the gravitational attraction of the Earth. If pressure and gravity were two separate and unrelated forces,  would  one not expect to find two distinctly separate organs to monitor these  phenomena? A  plane flies through the air; its forward motion produces a flow  of  air above the wing which creates a standing low pressure center.     The plane is sucked into the air, away from the Earth s  gravitational  field.  Again we observe an interplay between the forces  of  pressure  and gravity. When a rocket in space fires its engines, the same interplay of forces  are  at work. The rocket places a high pressure behind itself;  in  so  doing it can be said that a low pressure center exists in front of the  rocket, and the rocket moves in that direction. MR. SCIENCE & THE BREEZY ROOM I  have constructed a very special room. Its design allows for a  flow  of  air through the ceiling and floor of the room. It has  no  windows  and whoever is inside is unable to make any exterior observations.  As  with  Einstein s famous accelerating rocket,     the observer is  free  to  draw conclusions from any phenomena that take place in  the  room,  but he is unaware of the exterior environment. We  now  place  a  fan above the roof of the  room  which  forces  air  downwards. Air flows through the room and Mr. Science takes note. The room is now placed on a high tower some distance above the  Earth.  Imagine that we now pile an enormous quantity of air above the  tower.  Due to the Earths gravitational attraction which causes the atmosphere   hug  the planet, the air will flow back towards the Earth and  regain  its composure. In  doing so, the air will also flow through Mr. Science s room     he  takes note. When  asked about the nature of the two experiments, he tells us  that  he  believes them to be identical   a flow of air from top to  bottom.  He  is unaware that the first experiment was the result  of  pressure;  nor does he know that the second experiment was caused by gravity.  He  therefore  concludes that the nature of the force that  propelled  the  air  through the room was the same in both instances; to Mr.  Science,  pressure and gravity are identical! NATURE S GRAVITY WELLS Earlier,  I mentioned that a vortex in a stirred cup of coffee  mimics  the  force  of gravity. This phenomena is not limited to our  cup;  it  manifests itself throughout nature s domain. The  low pressure eye of a hurricane is a strangely tranquil place  in  which  there is little wind and the blue sky can be seen above,  while  on  all sides the high pressure fury circulates. Such is the power  of  the  hurricane s eye that the ocean has been observed to rise  several  feet  higher  in  this center than the  ocean  level  surrounding  the  eye.     This  rise  in  sea  level  is caused  by  the  low  pressure  of  the  hurricane s eye; the mass of the ocean in the eye is attracted to  the  relative vacuum. As with gravity, the attraction to the eye falls  off  with the square of the distance from its center. Spiral  galaxies mimic the vortex and their shape leaves us with  some  perplexing questions: If galaxies are gravitationally bound systems in  dynamic  equilibrium,  they should consist of enough  matter  to  hold  themselves together. Surprisingly, it would appear that there is not enough matter  present  in  galaxies  to  achieve  this, thereby giving  rise  to  the  famous   Missing Mass Problem .     How  does  a spiral galaxy obtain the additional  gravitational  force  when  it  does  not have a corresponding quantity  of  matter?  Is  it  possible that its high energy center is an Absolute Vacuum? If the GRAVAC scenario proves correct, then it is not an  unreasonable  speculation  that galactic centers of a spiral galaxies  are  inducing  gravity without a corresponding quantity of mass. THE CONSEQUENCES OF A GRAVAC SUN The  concept  of Absolute Vacuums may go some way  to  explain  Olbers  Paradox,  which states that, if space is infinite, why is the sky  not  bright with radiative sources? If space is interrupted with Absolute Vacuums,   and there would be as  many of these as there are stars   then any given area of space  would  in effect be  shielded  from other quadrants. If the Sun is merely a shell of mass and so has considerably less mass  than  hitherto expected, then it cannot afford to merely drift  around  living  off  its limited mass, or it would soon expend its  supply  of  fuel.  This suggests that there must be some mechanism  through  which  the Sun replenishes its dwindling fuel supply. I  would suggest that it does this by orbiting the  galaxy,   feeding   off  the  clouds and globules that pervade the Milky  Way.  The  Sun s  magnetic  and  gravitational  capacity make  for  an  efficient   food  foraging  mechanism. Both nebulae and Sun travel in the same direction  about  the  galaxy,  like cars traveling in the same  direction  on  a  highway. Although  the Sun is unlikely to collide with the nebulae on  a  given  trajectory, their mutual gravitational attraction will alter the Sun s  course  towards  the cloud and the Sun will plunge into  the  nebula s  hydrogen rich interior. It is estimated that the Sun s magnetic influence reaches well  beyond  the planets of our solar system. When highly accelerated particles  of  the  solar wind collide with the gas and dust of space, electrons  and  protons are knocked off from one another, thus making these  particles  within the Sun s heliosphere magnetically sensitive. This is  somewhat  similar  to the static cling you get in a drier. The charged  particle  follows the magnetic fieldlines to the north or south pole of the Sun,  depending on the polarity of the particle. The Sun s gravitational and  magnetic fields are an effective means of sweeping the galactic  plane  for matter.  We can see this effect on a smaller scale with our own planet when  we  watch  the  cascade of particles coming to Earth in the  form  of  the  Aurora Borealis.  In the same way the Sun consumes the matter which is necessary for its  continued existence. Our Sun is presently not in a nebula, and so it is not digesting  much  matter  at the moment, but if you look at stars in these nebulae,  you  will see that they are in a highly energetic state. I  suggest that this is due to the infalling matter which excites  the  surface  of these suns. Many astronomers believe that the high  energy  state of suns in nebulae is due to their youth, and they point to  the  Hurtzsprung Russell diagram as the proof of this. The  Hurtzsprung Russell  diagram plots stars on a chart in  order  of  their magnitude and temperature, and it is believed that this tells us  something about the evolution of stars. Can  we rely on such a diagram for evolutionary information?  Consider  this little story: An  umpire  is  standing in a crowded stadium. Upon  his  nose  is  an  intelligent  wart. This wart desires to know the process of  evolution  of its host, namely the umpire. In order to aid itself in this  quest,  the  wart observes the other people in the stadium. Although the  wart  cannot  see,  it is able to monitor heartbeats and blood  pressure  of  people present.  Armed with this information, the wart constructs a graph upon which it  places  the rate of hart beat and blood pressure of all the people  in  the stadium. The  wart  now mistakenly believes that by comparing  people  in  this  manner, it has acquired a system that displays a sequence of evolution  from youth to old age. In  reality,  the  graph  displays  no  such  information;  it  merely  describes  the  momentary  state of excitement of the  people  in  the  stadium. The same is true for stars in nebulae. Stars of any age  burn  hotter and brighter while feeding. CONCLUSION In      I stayed in Chicago with a friend who had been kind enough  to  give me lodging while I was organizing an exhibition of my artwork. One  evening,  after a particularly strenuous day I took a  long  lazy  soak in the bath. By chance I grabbed up an astronomy periodical which  lay atop a stack of magazines which happened to contain pictures taken  by the Voyager spacecraft which had recently passed through the Jovian  system.  Those images held me transfixed for hours, and the tub  water  was quite cold when I emerged from its primordial soup. Eight  years  later and after considerable reflection I  still  cannot  dissect,  much  less   put into any coherent  order  of  thought,  the  process that led to the chrysalis which formed in my mind; I can  only  offer its fruits.  These writings are an attempt to put the essence of that vision into a  semblance of order.  In  the process of writing this paper I have come to realize  that  we  live in an outrageously animated universe where nature s ingenuity  is  law. Within this cosm, no cohesive entity is allowed existence  unless  the   efficiency  of its structure  has  undergone  nature s  rigorous  trials. If suns feed through the manipulation of electromagnetism and gravity,  it  would seem reasonable to assume that they would do so in the  most  efficient way possible. Consider  natures   invention  of the strawberry flower.  This  is  an  efficient  device which allows for pollination and fruit.  Pollination  assures reproduction. The fruit which are derived from the  pollinated  flower  are specifically designed for the survival of  its  offspring.  The  seeds  that are imbedded on the surface of  the  strawberry  pass  unharmed  through  the  animal  digestive  system.  In  this  way  the  offspring are deposited in a rich compost, away from the parent  plant  thereby avoiding competition. I  propose that it is the nature of suns exhibit the same  measure  of  ingenuity. In  space, mass is scarce and suns will have evolved in such a way  as  to take the greatest advantage of the mass that is available to  them.  Mass    from which gravity and electromagnetism are derived   are  the  tools  with which suns seek their fuel. If suns can induce  gravity     make  more  gravity than the corresponding quantity of mass  allows     then they will have sought a way to do so, for it is the nature of all  life forms to seek an excellence of efficiency.  The  life urge is a universal and little understood force; it  is  the  common thread which holds the microcosm to the macrocosm.  I  think  it  unlikely that this thin sheath we call  a  biosphere  is  unique  in its essence; if we only choose to see, then  manifestations  of  life  are to be found on all scales of the cosm.  Seasons  repeat,  galaxies spin,  atoms oscillate.  Mankind  is often fooled into thinking of consistency as inanimate;  a  cup seems to be a cup from moment to moment, but why should it be  the  same cup? Is there any particular reason why we should believe an atom  is the same atom after each oscillation?  Can  we  maintain  that a forest is the same  forest  from  season  to  season?  Nor is the consistency of an ocean s color a result of the  inanimate;  on the contrary, its color is a celebration of life. The   unchanging   appearance  of an oceans color and hue is net result of the  countless  micro organisms in the process of living within its water.  Why  is  it so hard for us as humans to see and  comprehend  a  living  universe? In  our shells of being, we are trapped in our own time notion and  it  is  only  through  insight, patience and study  that  the  actions  of  smaller and larger cosms come to life for us. Humankind must resist falling prey to the vanity of uniqueness.  The  sum of our species has shown no more self determination than  any  other  species;  we mindlessly extract trapped carbon in the  form  of  coal and oil and eject it into the Earths atmosphere.  Is there purpose in this?  How would we know if we refuse to even consider the Earth as a  living  entity  of which we are an interacting part? We hurtle along,  blinded  by our lack of humility; if we refuse look about us in the midst of  a  living  universe,  how will we know oblivion even if we  were  rushing  directly towards it? I   suspect  that the vast majority of copies of this  paper  will  be  thrown  away without even being read. Some will be  casually   browsed  through before they are discarded. However, through the sheer force of  their  numbers  it  is quite possible that a few   such  as  you  dear  reader    will actually have read the paper in its entirety.  I  fancy someday, someone will be tempted to perform  the  occultation  experiment  which  I have described earlier in this paper.  I  suspect  that  this  will happen sooner or later anyway, and If  my  vision  is  false,  and  neutrinos pass through the Sun unimpeded, then  surely  I  have hurt or offended no one.  However, if it holds the seeds of truth   that gravity is no slave  to  matter    where lie the limits of humankind s destiny, if we learn  to  understand and control the nature of its force? It  is  quite possible that no one will remember  my  prediction  when  verified,  but that is of no consequence. The origin of an idea is  of  no  importance;  time  bleaches  the  pages  of  history,  names   are  eventually forgotten in the haze of time and no one is remembered  for  very  long. I suspect Nietzsche is wrong when he writes that the  only  things remembered are written in blood and stone. Overall,  humankinds  collective  memory is quite short and so it is only the concepts  that  become  indispensable and fundamental to the survival of  our  species  that  ever  remain  through the rise and fall of cultures  and  in  my  conceit, it is here that I stake my claim. Man  has no time but that river of dreams upon which he casts  himself  adrift.
